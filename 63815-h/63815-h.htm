by the most popular writers of interesting fiction for boys.
Among these may be mentioned the works of Burt L. Standish,

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>A LUDICROUS MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>“Stop dot tonkey!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Boom-te-boom-te-boom-boom!</p>

<p class='c008'>The bass drummer of the band at the head of “Haley’s
All-Star Combination and Mammoth Uncle Tom’s Cabin
Company” did not miss a beat when the three “fierce and
terrible untamed Siberian bloodhounds” darted between
his legs in pursuit of the escaping donkey.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the fat Dutch lad, who had been leading the
donkey, attempted to follow the dogs, there was a catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The excited Dutch lad struck the drummer squarely,
and the drummer uttered a yell of astonishment and terror.
Into the air he flew, down he came, and—boom!
bang! slam he went through the head of the drum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shimminy Gristmas!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dutch boy was startled by the havoc, but he quickly
recovered and started once more in hot pursuit of dogs
and donkey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hee-haw! hee-haw!” brayed the donkey, joyously
whisking its heels in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hear dot tonkey laugh!” shouted the Dutch boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dogs set up a wild baying, and there was no end
of commotion on the street along which the parade had
been making its way toward the Thalia Theater. Among
the spectators, some of the men laughed, while many of
the women screamed and made a scramble to get out of
the way of the terrible “bloodhounds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop dot tonkey!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pursuing lad waved his short arms wildly in the
air, his face flushed with excitement, his eyes bulging
from his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>The donkey made for a small fruit and cigar store,
seeming bent on rushing straight through the large window
where the goods were temptingly displayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A young man standing near the store placed himself
squarely in the path of the little animal, and skillfully
caught the dangling halter by which the creature had been
led.</p>

<p class='c008'>The donkey halted abruptly, while the dogs came up
and leaped around it, still baying.</p>

<p class='c008'>Puffing like a pony engine, the Dutch boy dashed up
and grasped the donkey’s tail with both hands, shouting:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vot der madder vos mit you, ain’d id? I can’t run
avay you from uf you vant me to! Now, don’d try any
uf my tricks on yourseluf, for uf you do, I vill——Wow!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Up flew the donkey’s heels once more, and the little
beast lifted the fat lad and sent him whirling over in the
air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The creature had seemed to kick with the force of a
pile driver, and he fairly flung the Dutch boy into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down came the lad, plunging headfirst into a garbage
barrel that had been standing on the curb, awaiting the
arrival of the garbage gatherers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Into the barrel plunged the boy. Fortunately the barrel
was not quite half filled. Down he went till he stuck
fast, his fat legs kicking wildly in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The youth who had stopped the donkey now released
the animal and started to extricate the boy from the
barrel.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tall, awkward youth, who had been with the parade,
forming one of the band, rushed up, brass horn in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darn my pertaturs!” he shouted, dropping the instrument.
“That ’air donkey will be the death of that feller
yit!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he made a grab at the legs of the lad in the barrel
and received a kick behind the ear that knocked him over
in a twinkling. He struck in a sitting position on the
ground, and there he remained, rubbing his head and looking
dazed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The youth who had stopped the donkey succeeded in
getting hold of the legs of the unlucky fellow in the barrel,
and dragged him out, after upsetting the barrel.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time everybody on the street was roaring with
laughter, and the donkey joined in with a ridiculous
“hee-haw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, my friend,” said the rescuer, as he released the
lad he had extracted from the barrel, “you are all right
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dutch boy sat up beside his friend who had started
to pull him out, and a most wretched spectacle he presented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oxcuse me!” he exclaimed, clawing dirt out of his
eyes. “I don’t like dot kindt uf peesness!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, what in thutteration did yeou want to kick the
head offen me for when I tried to pull yeou aout?”
snapped the other lad, glaring at him. “Yeou made me
see mor’n four bushels of stars, an’ there’s many’s four
hundrud an’ seventeen chime bells a ding-dongin’ in my
head naow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who id vos kicked my headt off you?” spluttered the
Dutch boy. “You nefer touched me. Vot der madder
vos, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The youth who had extracted the Dutch lad from the
barrel laughingly said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see you fellows are up to your old tricks. You are
quarreling, as usual.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hey?” cried the tall lad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vot?” squawked the Dutch boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How are you, Ephraim?” laughed the rescuer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jeewhillikins!” yelled the tall youth, jumping to his
feet, his face fairly beaming. “Jee-roo-sa-lum! Yeou
kin beat my brains out with a feather duster ef it ain’t
Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shimminy Gristmas!” howled the Dutch boy, wildly
scrambling up. “I hope I may nefer see your eyes oudt
uf again uf dot ain’t Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right,” nodded the rescuer. “I am Frank Merriwell,
just as sure as you are Ephraim Gallup and Hans Dunnerwurst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoop!” roared Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wa-ow!” bellowed Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they made a rush at the handsome fellow, who
had given his name as Frank Merriwell, flung their arms
about him, and literally danced as they hugged him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spectators looked on in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, great jumpin’ grasshoppers!” shouted the Yankee
lad. “Ain’t this the gol dingdest s’prise party I ever
struck!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I peen so asdonished I vos afraidt you vill die heardt
vailure uf britty queek alretty!” gurgled the delighted
Dutch lad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Break away!” laughed Frank. “You’ll have me off
my pins if you keep this up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gol darned ef I ever saw anybody whut could git yeou
offen your pins yit,” declared Ephraim Gallup.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw, dot vos righdt,” put in Hans. “Nopody peen
aple got your pins off you a hurry in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Jimminy!” squealed the Vermonter. “This is too
good to be true!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw!” agreed the Dutch boy; “dot vos shust righdt!
Id peen too true to peen goot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haow in thunder is it we find yeou here?” asked the
overjoyed Yankee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dot vos vot you’d like to know,” declared Hans.
“How id vos you happened to foundt us here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’d like to know how you two happen to be here,”
said Merriwell. “Have you turned showmen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou bet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We peen dwo uf der sdars der ‘All-Star Gombination’
in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re hot stuff, b’gosh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Efy blays der paratone horns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ Hans plays the donkey when the donkey gets sick
and can’t come on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Id vos a greadt shnap. We ged our poard vor our
glothes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ we’re havin’ a high old time travelin’ around over
the kentry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” smiled Frank, as they clung to his hands, “I
never dreamed of seeing you chaps traveling with a
show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We nefer knew vot you had pecome uf since der college
left you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ we was talkin’ abaout yeou last night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw. We said how you would enjoy yourseluf if
dese show vos dravelin’ aroundt mit you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a heap of fun in it, Frank. Whillikins! yeou’d
oughter be with us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You come to der theater und let der show seen you to-night,”
invited Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it!” cried Ephraim. “Won’t you do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think so,” smiled Merry. “But I want to see
you chaps before that. Have you taken dinner?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then take dinner with me, and we will have a jolly
time talking over old times. Will you do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You pet my life!” shouted the Dutch boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By gum, we will!” vociferated Ephraim. “Jest yeou
come up to the theater, an’ we’ll be reddy to go with yeou
inside of twenty minutes. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the other members of the company had secured
the donkey and dogs. The little donkey was turned over
to Hans again, with a warning not to let the creature get
away. Ephraim recovered his horn and took his place
in the band. The procession formed, the band struck up
vigorously, minus the bass drum, and the “All-Star Combination”
moved along the street as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, this little affair of the escaping donkey and
dogs was regarded as an incident that would serve to
help advertise the show, and that was exactly what satisfied
and pleased Barnaby Haley, owner and manager of
the organization.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK AND HIS FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The band played two pieces in front of the Thalia Theater.
The man who was handling the “fierce and untamed
bloodhounds” skillfully succeeded in getting all three of
them into a fight, appearing nearly frightened to death
over it. The donkey walked into the midst of the dogs
and separated them by taking the aggressor in his teeth
and pulling him away, and Barnaby Haley was well satisfied
with the advertising he would receive on account
of all this.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank, looking on, understood that the same things
happened in nearly every town visited by the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>The donkey was to be taken into the theater by the
stage entrance, but Hans found a chance to say to Frank:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shust vait here till dot theater comes oudt uf me. I
vill peen righdt pack a minute in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim induced one of the musicians to take charge
of his horn, and remained with Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans soon reappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now shust you took dot tinner to me,” invited the
Dutch lad. “I pelief a square meal can eadt me a minute
in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eat!” cried the Vermont lad. “Why, that Dutch
sausage can eat any gol darn time an’ all the gol darn
time! Never see northing like him in all my born days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, shust shut yourseluf ub!” cried Hans, quickly.
“Your mouth dalks too much mit you. You don’d peen
no ganary pird to eadt. You vos aple to ged der oudtside
uf a whole lot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, b’gosh! these air howtels we stop at some of um
have pritty blamed poor grub,” confessed the Yankee
youth. “Their beefsteak is made of luther, an’ their
bread might be bought up by ther loaf an’ used fer pavin’-stuns
on the streets.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I think I’ll be able to give you something to eat
that you can digest, but you mustn’t expect too much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We kin eat any old thing with you, Frank,” declared
Ephraim. “Why, when we was campin’ aout at Fardale
last summer we hed appetites like hosses, an’ it didn’t
make no diffrunce whut there was to eat, we jest et it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” nodded Hans; “und some uf der things vot
vasn’t to eadt we shust eated all der same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But naow we want yeou to tell us haow it happens
yeou are here, Frank,” urged Ephraim, as they walked
along together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank, who had formerly been a schoolmate of the
boys at Fardale Academy, after which he had gone to
Yale, briefly explained that he had been forced to leave
college on account of the loss of his fortune, and was
now making his own way in the world. The boys knew
he had left college, but they had not heard he was working
on a railroad. Both were astonished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darn my turnups!” cried Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shimminy Gristmas!” gurgled Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whut yeou been doin’ on the railroad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Running an engine,” explained Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Runnin’ it? Haow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Engineer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vot?” gasped Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come off!” palpitated Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have come off,” smiled Frank. “I am out of a job
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haow is that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Railroad made a reduction of wages, there was a
strike, big fight over it, rival road scooped all the business,
my road went to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ naow—whut?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The rival road has scooped the road I worked on—absorbed
it. A lot of old engineers have taken the places
of the men who used to run on the Blue Mountain road.
I’ve been trying for a show, but I’m so young they don’t
want to give me anything. Looks like I’d have to get
out of here and strike for something somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, that’s too darn bad!” drawled Ephraim, sympathetically.
“But haow’d you ever git to be ingineer,
anyhaow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Worked my way up. Began as engine-wiper in the
roundhouse, got to be fireman, then engineer. Right
there came the trouble, and now I’m on the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The eyes of the Vermonter glistened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the hanged old railroad hadn’t went up the spaout,
you’d bin runnin’ that in a year!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” nodded Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou’re a hummer!” declared Ephraim. “Yeou’ve
got lots of git there in ye, an’ that’s whut does the trick.
But I swan to man, it must have seemed tough to yeou
to have to git right aout an’ work like a Trojan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” put in the Dutch boy. “Vork nefer had nottinks
to done mit you pefore dot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see haow yeou brought yerself to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank looked grave and not exactly pleased.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have always expected to work when the time came,”
he asserted. “I hope you didn’t suppose for a moment
that I was going to spend my life in idleness?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, no!” the Vermonter hastily cried; “but yeou
wan’t reddy. Yeou was in college an’ havin’ a slappin’
good time. It was mighty rough to have ter break right
off from that all to once an’ git out an’ dig fer a livin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Merry, slowly, “I will admit that it was
not pleasant at first; but I made up my mind that it was
to be done, and I went at it heartily. After a time, I
came to enjoy it as I never enjoyed anything before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whut! Yeou don’t mean to say yeou liked it better
than playin’ baseball?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jee-roo-sa-lum!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better than anything. Work is the greatest sport in
the world, for it is a game at which one plays to win the
prize of his life. The winning of all other games are
tame in comparison with this. It draws out the best
qualities in a man, it tests him as nothing else can. Oh,
yes, work is the champion sport, and success is the prize
for which all earnest workers strive. The man who shirks
and fears honest work can never succeed in the world.
Determined men will push him aside, and he will be with
the losers at the end of the great game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup clapped Frank on the shoulder familiarly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou are yerself, b’gosh!” he cried. “I kin see that
yeou are soberer an’ stiddyer, but yeou are Frank Merriwell
jest the same. Yeou was alwus sayin’ things like
that that no other feller ever thought to say. There ain’t
no danger but yeou’ll be with the winner in this game
yeou’re talkin’ abaout.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uf der vinners don’d peen mit him they vill peen
der wrong side on,” asserted Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in here,” he said, “and I will introduce you to
a particular friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He led them into the small fruit and cigar store in
front of which he had been standing when the donkey
ran away from Hans.</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>“Hello, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank saluted the keeper of the store, who proved to
be a bright-faced, lame boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jack,” said Merry, “did you ever hear me speak of
Ephraim Gallup?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I have!” exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Hans Dunnerwurst?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, here they are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack Norton stared at Frank’s two companions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are the friends of whom I have told you; and
this, fellows, is Jack Norton, a hustling young business
man of this city. Some day he’ll be one of the greatest
retail merchants in the place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack blushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m gol darned glad to see ye!” declared the Vermonter,
striding up and grasping the lame lad’s hand.
“Anybody Frank Merriwell trains with is all right, an’
I’m ready to hitch hosses with ’um.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrung the young shopkeeper’s hand heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” nodded Hans, waddling up. “You vos plamed
clad to seen us, Shack. Shust catch me holdt your handt
uf. How you vos alretty yet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Frank has told me about you,” said Jack, “but I never
expected to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, we’re travelin’ araound with the greatest show
on earth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barnum’s?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not by a long shot! Barnum’s ain’t in it. Haley’s
‘All-Star Combination an’ Mammoth Uncle Tom’s Cabin
Company’ knocks ’em all aout.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dot’s vot der madder vos,” agreed Hans. “Dot gompany
has dwo ‘Topsys,’ dwo ‘Marks,’ dwo ‘Gumption
Cutes’——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ two jackasses,” grinned the Yankee youth. “One
of them leads the other every day in the street parade.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hey?” exclaimed the Dutch youth. “You don’d
mean——Say, you vill lick me a minute in uf I say dot
again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He squared off in a fighting attitude, seeming ready
to go at Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, there!” laughed Frank. “Up to your old
tricks, I see. Why, I believe you two fought a duel
once at Fardale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We did, b’jee!” nodded Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mit eggs,” spoke Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ripe aigs, at that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dose eggs couldt smell me vor a veek.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was awful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw; id peen a put ub shob us onto.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ Frank Merriwell was the feller whut put it up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw. I peliefed I vos all ofer plood mit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So did I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I nefer knewed pefore dot plood vos so pad to

<p class='c008'>“We never got even with him fer that sell, Hans.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nefer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll eat enough to-day to square the account.
He’ll think he’s run up ag’inst a cyclone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw, we vill done dot, Efy. You haf a greadt headt
on me, ain’d id!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if I can settle the score that way, I won’t kick,”
said Merry. “Is Nellie at home, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, she went home to get dinner. You know one
of us has to stay here and keep the shop open. We take
turns getting dinner. She will have it all ready when you
get there, but she may not have enough, for she won’t
know anyone is coming with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll fix that all right,” said Frank. “There is a restaurant
on the corner, and I can get all kinds of stuff
there to take out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t yeou shut up to-day an’ come with us, Mister
Norton?” asked Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” put in Hans, “shust haf der shop shut you up
und come along us mit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to do it,” said the lame lad, “but it might hurt
my business, and I believe in looking after one’s business
before anything else. Frank has taught me that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s alwus teachin’ somebody somethin’,” muttered
the Vermonter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slam!—open flew the door. Bounce!—in popped a
lively boy in a neat suit of clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Frank!” he cried. “Goin’ by w’en I seen yer
t’rough der window, an’ I t’ought I’d stop an’ speak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Bob, the newsboy, whom Frank had befriended
in his railroad days.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Bob!” exclaimed Merry. “On the jump, as
usual. How do you like your new position in the broker’s
office?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great!” was the instant answer. “Der boss treats
me fine, an’ he says w’en I’ve been ter night school long
ernough ter have der proper eddycashun, he’ll put me
onter der turns of der business. Oh, I’ll be a broker meself
some day, see if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank introduced Bob to Ephraim and Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, dis is great!” cried the former newsboy. “I’ve
heard Frank tell heaps of t’ings about youse chaps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He seemed genuinely delighted over the meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I invited them to dinner,” said Merry. “We wanted
Jack to come along, but he can’t close up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How long will it take?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he might be back in three-quarters of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he kin do it in dat time, I’ll stay right here an’ run
dis joint. I kin git back on time den. Go ahead, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but you are out for your own dinner,” protested
the lame boy. “It’s too much to expect you to do all that
for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not by a blame sight! Youse folks didn’t do a t’ing
fer me w’en I was down on me luck, did yer? No, not
a t’ing but take me in an’ keep me till I could git somewhere.
Now, don’t make any talk about dis t’ing,
but jest you skip right along with der odders. Only be
sure ter git back in time fer me ter git ter der office.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bob settled it that way, and Jack was carried off with
Frank and his two friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the way home, Merry stepped into a restaurant
and ordered plenty of food, which was given him in a
large pail, the pail being wrapped to disguise its real
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Nell, Jack Norton’s sister, was waiting for
Frank to appear when she recognized his familiar step
on the stairs. She rose hastily to her feet, but paused to
listen.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were other steps, and she realized that several
persons were coming. Wondering what it meant, she
waited till the door opened and the four filed into the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there were introductions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am pleased to meet any of Frank’s friends,” declared
the girl. “I am very pleased to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” nodded the lame boy. “She is pleased
to see you. Two weeks ago she could not have seen you
had she stood face to face with you as she does now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t toldt you so!” exclaimed Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whut was the matter?” asked Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was blind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Plind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, stone blind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jeewhillikins! She kin see all right naow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By a miracle. We were saving money to have her
treated by a great oculist in New York, and we had almost
enough. One night she got up in a dream and
walked out to those stairs. She fell all the way to the
bottom, striking on her head. I dragged her up the
stairs and got her into bed. The next morning she could
see. I believe it was the work of God!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was marvelous!” put in Merriwell. “You see, she
was not born blind, but received a blow on the head that
injured the optic nerve in some manner so she became
blind. Most marvelously, by falling and striking on her
head, the shock restored her sight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the money we had saved we put into our little
business,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, you nefer heardt such a peculiar thing as that
uf pefore!” cried Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I doubt if anyone ever did. Nellie, I have brought
my friends to dine with me, and here is plenty of food
that I bought at the restaurant. All you have to do is
get it onto the table.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do that,” laughed the happy girl. “It seems so
good to be able to do such work! We will have a delightful
dinner! I am so glad you brought them, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, b’gosh!” exclaimed Ephraim; “that’s whut
makes a feller feel right to hum! Naow I know I’ve got
right among the kaind of folks I take to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” nodded the Dutch boy; “id makes beoble feel
like you vos right to home. Oxcuse us uf we make ourseluf
so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead,” invited Frank. “I want you to feel free
here.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c002'>It was truly a jolly party that sat down to the table when
it was spread and everything prepared. Ephraim, Frank
and Hans talked over old times, spoke of the jolly days
at Fardale, where they had attended school, recalled the
struggles, sports, jokes, night raids and hazings.</p>

<p class='c008'>All too soon the time came when Jack was forced to
leave in order to get back to his shop in time to let Bob
return to his duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just hate to go!” he exclaimed. “It seems good to
hear you talk about those times. I never had any chance
to go to school like that. It must have been such heaps
of sport!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say,” cried Ephraim, “looker here, can’t yeou take yer
sister an’ go to the show this evenin’?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both of us cannot go, for the shop must be kept open
in the evening the same as any other time. Nellie can go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh all hemlock! can’t the thing be fixed somehow so
ye kin go together? I’ll see to it that yeou git the best
seats in the haouse. Yes by gum! I’ll git one of the boxes
fer ye if yeou’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Jack!” broke from Nellie. “You know I’ve never
been to see a real theater show, but now I think my eyes
are strong enough to stand the light. Can’t we go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see how,” answered Jack, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can fix it with Bob,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t have to work evenings, and you can get
him to keep shop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so!” exclaimed the girl, clapping her hands.
“Try it, Jack—do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The face of the lame lad brightened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he said, “I’ll ask him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you will go with us, won’t you, Frank?” asked
Nellie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Inza were here now we’d have a splendid party.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Inza!” gasped Ephraim. “Inza Burrage? Has she
been here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the winter. She was visiting a friend. Left a
little more than a week ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dot vos too pad!” murmured Hans. “She vould haf
been deekled to seen me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry we didn’t git here afore she went,” said the
Vermonter; “but we had the fun of seein’ Elsie Bellwood
abaout a month ago, though it wasn’t much fun, come to
think of it, she was feelin’ so darn bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Inza Burrage and Elsie Bellwood had been two dear
girl friends of Frank in his college days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank sprang to his feet, his face working with excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Saw Elsie?” he cried, amazed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” nodded Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In Bittsburg.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pittsburg?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s true,” declared Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whut’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—why, I heard she had sailed with her father
for a long voyage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But now she is in Pittsburg? Why, how can that be?
It was not many months ago they sailed—some time last
fall, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And they were to be gone a year?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then something happened?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ain’t heered abaout it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Justin Bellwood died the second day out from New
York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank gasped for breath, caught hold of the back of
his chair, and stood staring at the Vermonter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Justin—Bellwood—dead?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke the words slowly, as if he did not quite realize
what they meant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” said Hans, “he vos a gone case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then—then Elsie is left all alone in the world. Poor
little Elsie! I supposed she was far away on the ocean.
What was she doing in Pittsburg?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was living there with some of her folks or some
of her friends, I dunno which. Didn’t git much chaince to
talk with her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you found out her address—where she was living?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad! I must know where she is—I must communicate
with her as soon as possible. This is terrible
news!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry sat down weakly, and his manner showed how
he was affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Jack whispered something to Nellie, and then
slipped out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden gloom had come over the merry gathering.
Hans and Ephraim looked at each other dolefully. Little
Nell got up and came round to Frank, putting an arm
about his neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear Frank,” she whispered, “you know Heaven
orders everything for the best. You must have perfect
trust.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put his arm about her slender waist, drew her to
him and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear little comforter,” he said, in his low, musical
voice, “I am sure Heaven orders everything for the
best, for many a time I have seen apparent misfortune
prove a blessing in disguise. For instance, your falling
downstairs. But this separation from Elsie is hard. Before
I became a day laborer, forced to depend on my
hands for a living, I could have spent money freely in
tracing her and finding her. Now that is an impossibility.
We separated for a year, neither dreaming of the changes
a few months would bring about. I fear those changes,
instead of bringing us nearer together, have torn us
further apart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nellie was surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Frank!” she exclaimed, “you are seldom this
way. You are so light-hearted and hopeful. Nothing
seems to daunt you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is true, but things have been going against me
for some time now, and it is but natural that I should not
feel as cheerful as usual. The railroad strike came just
when my prospects were brightest, and then, at the very
hour when it seemed certain everything would be settled
and I should go back to my old job, the railroad went to
the wall and the F. B. &amp; Y. swallowed it. Now comes the
news of Elsie’s misfortune, and I cannot extend to her a
helping hand. I cannot even write to her, for I do not
know her address.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust in Heaven. All will come right in the end.
That is the lesson you have taught me, Frank. You say
justice always triumphs. Remember the case of Darius
Conrad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I know. I will have perfect trust, little girl.
But I must do something—I must find work right away,
for I have been idle too long. If I cannot get back onto
the railroad, I must do something else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’d you gone der show pusiness indo?” asked
Hans. “I pet me your life you vould like him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s raight,” drawled Ephraim. “Gosh! I wish
yeou was in our company. It would be great.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does the ghost walk regularly?” asked Merry, with a
slight smile.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

“There was a time when we run ag’inst mighty hard business,
an’ Haley got three weeks behind; but we’ve been

<p class='c008'>“Oxcept me,” said Hans, ruefully. “Mein salary’s peen

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Merry, “I hardly think I’ll go into the
theatrical business; but we’ll come and see the play to-night,
if you get that box for us, Ephraim.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh I’ll git it, yeou bet!” assured the Vermonter. “I’ll

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>MURDEROUS REALISM.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Jack, the lame boy, succeeded in getting Bob to keep
shop for him that evening, and so he was able to attend the
theater with his sister and Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup kept his word and secured a box for
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Nell was in raptures when they were seated in
the box and “Haley’s Mammoth Gold Band” played the
overture in the place of an orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>The band was made up of an odd collection of human
beings, but they had practiced on a few pieces till they
could “tear them off” in a style that was pretty sure to
please the uneducated ear and catch the fancy of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup sat up proudly and puffed out his
cheeks as he blew away at his horn. He was aware that
Frank Merriwell must be regarding him with interest,
and he was determined to do his best.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it lovely!” murmured little Nell, as she sat with
one hand clasped in her brother’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Despite the age of the play, the house was filled with
spectators. It was a “popular price” theater, and its patrons
were the common people. The gallery was packed
with youngsters who were there to sympathize with “Uncle
Tom,” applaud “George Harris,” laugh with “Topsy” and
“Gumption Cute,” and hiss “Simon Legree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the band had finished playing, the gallery broke
into a roar, amid which could be distinguished cat calls,
screams and shrill whistles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The footlights flashed, and the musicians played a
“riser” as the curtain rolled swiftly up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The play was on, and little Nell was enchained, enraptured,
enchanted. For the first time in her life she saw a
genuine “theater show,” and, within three minutes, everything
happening on the stage was true as life for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a great satisfaction for Frank to watch the face
of the girl. He saw how keenly she was enjoying everything,
and her enjoyment gave him the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry soon saw that this “All-Star Combination” was
made up of “ham-fatters,” among whom were two or three
fairly good people. Haley knew how to catch the crowd
with specialties, and he had introduced singing and dancing
into every act.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank watched for Hans. The Dutch lad appeared at
last, blackened with burnt cork, representing one of the
negro laborers. He did not have any lines, which was
fortunate, as his dialect would not have corresponded with
his color.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans was one of the slaves on sale at the auction at
which “Simon Legree” obtained possession of “Uncle
Tom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the play was half finished little Nell was greatly
wrought up over it. The escape of “Eliza” over the floating
ice, with the bloodhounds in pursuit, was well done,
and it caused the gallery to go wild.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the curtain went down after that climax, little
Nell fell back in her chair, crying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Frank, isn’t it wonderful! I never knew anything
could be so real and still a play.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From where he sat, Merry could see through one of
the open stage entrances at the opposite side. Several
times he saw some of the actors pause there and watch
what was taking place on the stage. It happened that he
was looking through that entrance when one of them
stopped there, glanced quickly around, and produced a
bottle from one of his pockets. The man quickly uncorked
the bottle and took a long drink from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was the one who played the part of “Legree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the man next appeared on the stage, Merry saw
he was drunk. Frank watched him closely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That fellow acts to me as if he is out for trouble,” he
thought. “I believe he is well cast in the piece, for he
seems to be a ruffian by nature.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank sat so near the stage that he was able to see bits
of by-play that the audience did not catch. Thus it happened
that he saw “Legree” give “Uncle Tom” a look of
genuine hatred and make a menacing gesture toward him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry instantly “tumbled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trouble between them,” he decided.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later, when both these characters were off the
stage, Frank saw “Legree” again prepare to take a drink
in the wings. Just as he tipped the bottle to his lips, a
hand reached out and caught it from his grasp.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crash!—it was smashed on the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Tom” was there, and he started in to remonstrate
with the intoxicated actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Legree” was furious, and he tried to grasp the other
by the throat. He was held off some seconds, a sharp
struggle taking place. Then he succeeded in getting one
hand fastened on the throat of the man who was impersonating
the leading character of the play.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Tom’s” fist was lifted, and he struck his assailant
fairly between the eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down went “Legree!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell felt like applauding the little drama
behind the scenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Tom” departed, and, after a time, some of the
players came and assisted “Legree” to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell now knew there were two men in the
company who were bitter enemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Jack and Nellie had been so absorbed in what was
taking place on the stage that they had not observed the
encounter behind the scenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank watched for the two men when they should next
appear on the stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Tom” was calm as ever when he came on. He
was a fairly good actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Legree” came on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Watching them closely, Merry heard some low-spoken
words pass between them while the action of the piece
was being carried on by other characters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’ll fix you for that!” hissed “Legree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re drunk!” declared the other, contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Am I? Well, it’s none of your business! I’ll soak
you before the night is over!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Try it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will! I’ll kill ye!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they went on playing their parts as if nothing unusual
had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is bad blood between them,” decided Frank,
“and the fellow with the rum in him is dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not realize how dangerous till the scene was
being played where “Legree” lashes “Uncle Tom” to
death with a heavy whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simon” came on with the whip, and there was a strange
glitter in his dark eyes. With his first blow at the old
slave, he caused “Uncle Tom” to collapse, uttering a yell
of pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the whip had whistled through the air, wielded by
a powerful arm, and the hissing lash had curled about the
body of “Uncle Tom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience looked on spellbound, rather astonished
by the realism of this whipping scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grinding his teeth together, “Legree” bent over and
pitilessly cut the writhing man with the whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cries of pain broke from the fallen man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Curse you!” Merry heard “Legree” hiss. “Here is
where I fix you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Help!” cried “Uncle Tom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a genuine appeal for aid. This was not acting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell started to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” gasped little Nell—“oh, Frank, he is really murdering
‘Uncle Tom’!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hanged if it doesn’t look that way!” Merry admitted
to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whip dropped from “Legree’s” hand. It struck
the floor heavily, but the man caught it up in a twinkling,
reversing it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, with the loaded butt, he struck “Uncle Tom” a
savage blow on the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stricken man straightened out, quivering in every
limb.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the expression of a fiend on his face, “Legree”
lifted the heavy whip again to bring the butt down upon
the man’s head. It seemed to be his purpose to smash
the skull of the actor he hated.</p>

<p class='c008'>As one man, the audience rose and stood, uttering a
cry of horror, for everyone seemed to realize that this
was not acting.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was murder!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The word shot like a bullet from the lips of a handsome
youth who went flying over the rail of the right-hand
proscenium box and alighted on the stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Drop it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell dashed at the murderous actor, caught
the whip, tore it from his hand, flung it aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they grappled!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK’S POPULARITY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The audience shouted its astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Off!” snarled the actor, trying to break from Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Steady!” commanded Merry. “You have gone over
the limit. What are you trying to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said I’d fix him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s in luck if you haven’t done it already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the fellow tried to strike Frank, but Merry warded
off the blow. In another moment a fierce struggle was
taking place between them in full view of the audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up to this time the actors behind the scenes had seemed
asleep or paralyzed with surprise. Now they came rushing
onto the stage and surrounded the combatants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley himself came on. He was greatly excited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seize that fellow!” he ordered, pointing at Frank.
“Where are the police? I’ll have him arrested for interfering
with the show!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Down the aisle rushed two policemen, clambering over
the footlights and onto the stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>The actors, directed by the manager, had torn Frank
and “Legree” apart. Merriwell flung off those who attempted
to hold him, and stood there in their midst.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Arrest him!” commanded Haley.</p>

<p class='c008'>A long, lank, awkward youth came scaling over the
footlights from the midst of the band. With two long
strides he reached Merriwell and planted himself by
Frank’s side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on, b’gosh!” he cried, flourishing the brass horn
he carried. “You don’t arrest him in a hurry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out from the wings rushed a fat lad, with a blackened
face. He took a position on the other side of Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw, py shimminy!” he gurgled! “he don’d arrest you
a hurry in alretty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank’s friends were on hand. Ephraim and Hans
were there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley gasped with surprise, and the policemen
hesitated a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this? what’s this?” spluttered the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Business, by gum!” declared the Vermonter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw!” nodded Hans, “id peen pusiness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This man attacked Storms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, I guess it was a gol darn good thing for Havener
that he did. Mebbe Storms has fixed Havener anyhaow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jest take a look at Havener an’ you’ll find aout.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Tom” was lying where he had fallen, and a
hasty examination showed he was unconscious, while
blood was flowing from a wound on his head, caused by
the blow from the butt of the whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley, who had not seen the encounter between the two
actors, was dazed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who did it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup’s long index finger pointed straight at
the one who had impersonated “Legree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“With that whip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but why should he do——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask him. He’s had a grutch ag’in Havener fer a
month, an’ to-night he tried ter kill him right here on the
stage afore all these people!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right!” shouted fifty voices from the audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is the one to be arrested!” roared a man standing
in the front row of the first balcony. “I know t’other
feller. He’s Frank Merriwell, an’ he’s the right sort.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell! Many persons in the audience had
recognized Merry when he leaped on the stage, but the
mention of his name sent a surge of emotion over the
entire house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now they knew him! The name of Frank Merriwell
was familiar to everybody in that city, for the prominent
part he had taken in the railroad strike had advertised him
thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Frank’s greatest admirers were aroused. Up in
the gallery a red-headed boy poised himself on the rail
and shrilly yelled:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, wot’s der matter wid Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the gallery broke into an answering roar:</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s—all—right!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat’s wot!” screamed the red-headed boy. “Let him
erlone an’ see wot he’ll do ter ‘Simon Legree’!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He won’t do a thing to him!” significantly bellowed
half the gallery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If dem cops puts a fin on him, we’ll come down an’
wipe up der the-a-tur with ’em!” threatened the red-headed
champion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat’s what we will!” shouted the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank looked up, smiled and bowed. That smile was
enough to set his admirers wild. They howled, roared,
clapped and stamped till the gallery shook and threatened
to come down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great gosh!” cried Ephraim Gallup, in Merry’s ear;
“I ruther think yeou’ve got a few friends in this ’air
taown!”</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the policemen was examining the wound on the
head of the unconscious actor. He spoke to a companion:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call an ambulance,” he said. “It looks to me as if this
chap’s skull may be cracked. He may never recover consciousness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it possible?” gasped Barnaby Haley, who had
heard the words. “And Storms did it? I declare!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned and glared at the drunken actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter with you?” he asked. “Are you
mad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Storms did not reply, but now he began to show symptoms
of fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Havener is dead, I’ll see that you hang for it!” declared
the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall we arrest Mr. Merriwell?” asked one of the
policemen, a touch of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no!” cried Haley. “My gracious, no! It seems
that I was mistaken concerning his purpose. He sprang
onto the stage to stop Storms—to keep him from finishing
his work. Do not molest Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The gallery heard this, and shouted its delight. The
red-headed boy stood up and screamed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“T’ree cheers fer Frank Merriwell! Open yer t’roats
ev’rybody!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the entire audience, catching the spirit of the occasion,
broke into a mighty cheer, bringing the hot blood to
Merry’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, b’gosh!” sighed Ephraim Gallup, with satisfaction.
“Naow yeou’ve got whut ye deserve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” agreed Hans, “now you haf got vot I deserfe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell! Merriwell! Speech! Speech!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience was calling for a speech, but Frank simply
shook his head and flatly refused to make a speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Arrest ole ‘Legree’!” howled the red-headed boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Barnaby Haley, speaking to the officers. “I
want you to arrest him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Storms glanced quickly around, as the officer stepped
toward him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like a flash he snatched out a revolver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As well for two as for one!” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up went his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Click!</p>

<p class='c008'>The hammer of the revolver fell, but there was no report.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cartridge had failed to explode, and Frank Merriwell’s
life was spared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uttering a howl of rage, the fellow flung the weapon
at Merry, striking him fairly on the breast and staggering
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, with a shout of defiance, the desperate actor made
a run and a leap, sailing out over the footlights, out over
the heads of the band, and alighting on his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop him!” Haley cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up the aisle flew the fugitive. The policemen sprang
after him, but no one seemed to care to get in the ruffian’s
path, so he dashed through an open door and disappeared.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>AN ENGAGEMENT OFFERED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The patrons of the Thalia Theater had been given a surprising
sensation that evening, and they did not think of
demanding their money back when they were forced to
file out without seeing the final scene of the play.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name of Frank Merriwell seemed to be on every
tongue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley was quick to see the advertising value
of the affair, which, at first, he had regarded as most unfortunate.
He perceived that Frank Merriwell was well
known and popular with the common people, such as
patronized that house.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had not proved necessary to remove Roscoe Havener,
the injured actor, in an ambulance. Havener was carried
to a dressing room, where he soon recovered consciousness,
and his injury was dressed by a physician, who
pronounced it a mere scalp wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley had taken Frank down into the dressing room,
where he was profuse in the expression of his thanks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Havener,” he said, “I believe you owe your life
to the prompt action of this young man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” said the actor, staring at Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” assured the manager. “He was in a proscenium
box, and he sprang onto the stage and grappled with
Storms in time to keep the fellow from hitting you again
with the heavy end of the whip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I am sure I am much obliged, Mr. Merriwell,”
said Havener, holding out his hand, which Frank took.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t mention it,” said Merry. “I happened to be
watching Storms, for I saw he had it in for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he was dead nuts on me. I’m the stage-manager,
you know, and I have been calling him down lately for
drinking. He got so he hated me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I heard him tell you he would ‘fix’ you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he did that, but I did not dream he would try
anything on the stage. I wasn’t prepared at all. The
first cut he gave me with that whip seemed to take all the
strength out of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Saw it,” nodded Frank. “Hardly thought he was in
the habit of putting it on that way every night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess not!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The way you cried out told me it was a genuine surprise
to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should guess yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That made me ready for what followed, but was not
quite quick enough to keep him from hitting you the first
time with the butt of the whip. I stopped the blow he
intended for a finisher, just the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And earned my everlasting gratitude, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They were ready to arrest me for interrupting the
play,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley flushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must forget that, Mr. Merriwell,” he said. “I
didn’t see Storms hit Havener, so I could not understand
why you jumped on the stage and grappled with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I understood it, b’gosh!” broke in Ephraim Gallup,
who was on hand; “an’ yeou kin bet I was goin’ to
stan’ by Mr. Merriwell if it took a wing off me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” came gravely from the Dutch boy, who was
likewise there, “Vrank Merrivell nefer made a misdake
your life in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem to know Mr. Merriwell,” insinuated Haley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, I guess we do!” cried the Vermonter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You petter pelief we do!” exclaimed the Dutch youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We was old chums at skule,” explained Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw, we peen shums at Vardale,” elaborated Hans.
“Dot peen vere he hadt der bleasure our aguaintance uf
makin’ alretty then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seemed rather remarkable that you took sides with
him so promptly, but it’s all right. The papers will be full
of it to-morrow, and we ought to get a good run here the
next two nights. I’ll have to get a man to fill Storms’
place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” quickly said Havener. “I’ll never play
with him again. If he’s arrested, I am going to push him
for what he did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you do that, you’ll have to stay in this place some
time,” declared the manager; “and you can’t stay here
without breaking your contract. I can’t spare you, for
you know the loss of Storms will make me two men short.
I need a prompter and property man, and need him bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim nudged Frank, whispering:</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s your chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess not,” smiled Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Vermonter said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you make Mr. Merriwell an offer, Mr.
Haley? He’s a gol darn hustler, an’ he’s aout of a job
jest naow. Mebbe yeou could git him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s not likely he knows anything about the business,”
said the manager, looking Frank over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal,” declared Gallup, “yeou’ll find he kin l’arn ther
quickest of anybody yeou ever see. I’ll reckermend him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Und I vos anodder,” put in Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you looking for an opening, Mr. Merriwell?” asked
the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am looking for some kind of a job,” confessed Frank.
“Must do something, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem like a bright young man. Perhaps we
might agree, if you are willing to take hold and do not
expect too much money at first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow the idea of going on the road with a show
appealed to Frank. Had he been working at anything
steady just then he would not have thought of giving up
his job to take such an engagement; but he was doing
nothing, and any kind of a job was preferable to idleness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” he said, slowly. “I haven’t thought
about going into such work, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might think about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Possibly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. I’ll be ready to make you an offer to-morrow,
if you are ready to come right away. I’ll be in the
box office of the theater at eleven in the morning. Will
you call?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do so. It won’t do any harm, even if we don’t agree.
I shall be glad to see you, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was ready to go. He knew Jack and Nellie
would wonder what had become of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans and Ephraim accompanied him, and they found
the brother and sister waiting near the entrance of the
theater.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Frank!” cried little Nell. “We didn’t know
where you had gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told her you would turn up all right,” asserted Jack,
“but she was nervous after that fight on the stage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was dreadful!” shuddered the girl. “I was so frightened!
I saw that wretch was really and truly hurting
‘Uncle Tom,’ but I didn’t expect you would jump right
onto the stage, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had to do it,” smiled Merry. “Case of necessity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did it so quick, and you handled that ruffian! I
never saw a fight before in my life, and it frightened me.
But I was so proud of you when all the crowd was shouting
your name and cheering. They all seemed to know
you, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right, by gum!” cried Ephraim. “Yeou seem
to be purty nigh as well known here as yeou was at skule.
Guess yeou’re bound to be pop’ler wherever yeou go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I pet a dandy goot actor vould make him,” said Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I ruther think he’d make a good actor,” agreed
Ephraim. “He will hev a chaince before he’s bin with
Haley long, if he goes with the show. Better do it, Frank.
We’ll hev heaps of fun.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw, dot’s vot’s der madder!” cried Hans. “You’d
petter took dot shob uf he don’d pay a goot lot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Nell showed her alarm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What job is that?” she asked, flutteringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“P’r’aps he’ll hev a chaince to go aout on the road with
aour show,” explained Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he’ll have to leave us!” cried Nellie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, little gal, it’s too bad, but he can’t stay here an’
live on wind. That’s sartin sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we don’t want to lose him like that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Folks hev to make a livin’. He ain’t got money to
burn, same as he had once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I had, I should be very careful how I burned it,”
asserted Merriwell. “I have learned the value of money,
and it will be precious little that I shall throw away foolishly
in the future. Must be going home now. Good-night,
fellows. See you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou’d better engage with Haley,” cried Ephraim, as
Frank moved away with Jack and Nellie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” shouted Hans. “Uf you don’d you vill peen
sorry all mein life. Goot-night.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK ACCEPTS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The following day Frank went down to the Thalia
Theater at the time appointed, and he found Manager
Haley waiting for him in the box office, as he had said he
would be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry was invited in, and he accepted the invitation.
He was given an introduction to the ticket seller, and then
Haley asked him into a little room adjoining the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve struck a man this morning to fill Storms’ place,”
he said, “and now, if we can make arrangements, the company
will be all right again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did the officers arrest Storms?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. He got away, but he’s broke, and they’ll get him
all right, unless he counts the ties.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Counts the ties?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; walks out of town on the railroad. I’m glad to
be rid of him. He made a good ‘Legree,’ but he was a
quarrelsome fellow, always kicking up a fuss. He made
more trouble in the company than all the others put together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The manager opened a little closet door and took out
a bottle and glasses. He placed a glass before Frank on
the table that served as a desk, and then shoved the bottle
toward Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Help yourself,” he urged. “I’ll get some water for
chasers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whisky—good whisky, too. Needn’t be afraid of it.
Took particular pains to get good stuff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not care for any,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? Don’t? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never drink whisky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Singular! Young man, good color, full of life. Can’t
be you prefer rum?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brandy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. I do not drink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t drink? Why, you take something occasionally?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so? What made you swear off? Going it
pretty hard?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t swear off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; I never took a drink of liquor in my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley stared hard at Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I were running a dime museum, I’d engage you as
a freak,” he said, in a manner that brought the color to
Merry’s face. “You’ll excuse me if I take a snifter. It’s
my time for one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead, sir,” bowed the youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Haley poured out a brimming glass of the stuff
and dashed it off without a “chaser.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” he said, smacking his lips. “That’s all right.
Better than we’ll get when we get further west.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put away bottles and glasses. Then, turning to
Frank once more, produced a cigar case, opened it and
held it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have a weed?” he invited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excuse me,” protested Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What? Oh, go ahead! Those are no two-fers; they’re
straight tens. Needn’t be afraid of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not afraid of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not? What’s the matter, then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not smoke.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The manager stared harder than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t——Do you swear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’m afraid you won’t make a first-class property
man. No man can handle properties unless he swears.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t suppose it was absolutely necessary to swear
in order to do any kind of work successfully,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never knew a property man who didn’t swear. If
you take the place, you’ll learn to swear within a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it must be a position that provokes a man’s
ill nature?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is—riles him all up. Going to tell you just what it
is before we talk business. Then you’ll know what you
are going up against.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the manager sat down and told Merry all about
the requirements and duties of a first-class property man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see, it won’t be no fat job,” said Haley. “I’d
rather you’d understand at the start, for you might get disgusted
with it after a short time if you went with us
thinking you had a soft snap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not looking for snaps,” declared Merry. “I expect
to work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll be all right. Some young chaps think traveling
with a show and acting is all play. Didn’t want you to
start out with such a notion. Gallup, who plays in the
band, says you’re a wonder at anything you attempt to do,
and I’ve been making some inquiries about you in town
this morning. You did chop frost for a short time after
getting a job on the railroad, and that’s a fact. They say
your rise was phenomenal. But the strike knocked you
out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; and now I must do something for a living.
Doesn’t seem to be any show for me to get a job railroading
right away, so, if we agree, I am willing to engage
with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They talked it over a long time, and finally came to
terms. Frank was not to receive much money at first, but
Haley said he would do better after he had learned all
about his business.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim and Hans knew of Frank’s appointment with
the manager, and they were waiting for him outside the
theater when he appeared. Both made a dive for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did yeou do it?” asked Gallup, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw!” cried Hans, “did it do you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going with the company, if that is what you want
to know,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glory!” shouted the Vermonter, catching his hand
and wringing it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Py Chorch! dot vos pully!” gurgled Hans, getting
hold of his other hand and trying to pull his arm out of
the socket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, we’ll jest have haydoogins of fun!” declared the
Yankee youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You pet my life!” fluttered the Dutch youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank went home and found little Nell there, anxiously
awaiting his return.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” she asked, immediately on his appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am engaged,” answered Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>A deep cloud came over her face, and she slowly
turned away. He hastened to her side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know, I must do something for a living, Nellie,”
he quickly said. “I cannot remain idle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” she nodded, chokingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have been idle too long. Last night I did not sleep.
I was thinking of Elsie. I must earn money; I must find
her. I feel that she needs my aid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Frank, you will not be able to find her if you are
traveling over the country with a show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall be earning something. When spring comes, I
shall go in search of her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but it will be so lonely when you are gone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face dropped in her hands, and she gave a choking
sob. He had his arm about her in a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not fated that we shall be together always, Nellie,”
he said. “I have been with you some time, and fortune
has turned in your favor during that time. You were
blind when I first saw you; now you can see. You have
a snug little business which will grow, and you will prosper
and be happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face was hidden by her hands, and she made no
reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t do that way, Nellie!” he implored, gently. “We
shall meet again—some time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some time!” she sobbed. “When?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t tell that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned quickly, reached up and put her arms about
his neck, burying her face on his breast, where she wept,
while he vainly tried to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nellie, Nellie, don’t!” he pleaded, his own voice husky.
“I can’t bear this! Please don’t—for my sake!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For your sake!” she murmured. “For your sake,
Frank, I’ll try not to cry. You have been so good to us.
Oh, I shall miss you so much! Heaven bless and keep
you, Frank! Heaven guide you to Elsie! May you
prosper—may you always be happy! I shall pray for you
every night!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I shall pray for you, dear little friend,” he said,
in his sincere, manly way. “I will write to you often.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they sat down together, hand in hand, and talked
of the future.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK’S UNPLEASANT DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>A week later Frank had become pretty familiar with his
duties. Besides being “manager of properties,” he was
the prompter, and he found plenty of work.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took hold of the new work readily, and Barnaby
Haley soon became satisfied that he had made no mistake
in engaging him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The company was “on the road,” playing one-night
stands, having abandoned the larger cities.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a case of hustle day after day. The moment the
show was over at night everything had to be picked up
and packed for the morning train.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank soon became familiar with all the stuff, so that
he knew just where everything belonged, and this enabled
him to do the packing swiftly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain amount of special scenery was carried for the
piece, and that was the most difficult to handle.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as Merry had taken care of the properties, he
was expected to lend his aid in getting the scenery ready
for shipment, and thus it came about that he seldom got to
bed before one or two o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it was necessary for him to be up early to see that
everything got off right, and, immediately on arriving at
a destination, he had to attend to the getting of the baggage
to the theater.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arriving at the theater, he was required to have the
trunks placed in the proper dressing rooms, the people
who played the leading parts always being allotted by the
stage-manager to the most convenient, commodious and
handy rooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the assignment of dressing rooms caused no
small amount of ill feeling, but Frank tried to keep things
as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>He soon showed he was not afraid of work, for which
reason a large amount of work it was not his duty to perform
was thrust upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he started in at this business, as he had at railroading,
to learn everything possible about it in the shortest
possible time. Thus it came about that, having assisted
in the work of making the stage ready, in one week’s time
there was not a scene of the play that he could not set
properly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not long before the stage-manager discovered
this, and he began to take a still greater interest in Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say,” he broke out one night, as Frank was assisting
in the setting of the stage, “what are you trying to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Helping,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but you are helping differently from any novice
I ever saw before. You take hold as if you were trying
to do all there is to be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to do my part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You want to do more than that, and I fancy you know
it, for you are no fool. What’s the object?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I’m going to follow this business any length of time,
I am going to know all I can about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that’s it! Well, that’s all right as far as it goes, but
you will get tired of it. Fellow who is willing to do his
work and everybody else’s work is pretty sure to get
crowded. Better let up on it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you. I don’t believe anybody will crowd me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right; do as you like. I’m willing you should as
long as you don’t attempt to get in front of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was said with a laugh, but Merriwell caught the
significance of the words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be afraid, Mr. Havener,” he said. “I am not
seeking anybody’s chance in this company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had become acquainted with the different members
of the company, and the personality of each interested
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arthur Sargent, the new man, who filled the place of
Errol Storms, playing “Simon Legree,” was a man quite
unlike Storms. He was a jolly, good-natured fellow off
the stage, always joking and telling stories. But he did
make a fierce “Legree,” and he was detested and hissed
by the small boy in the gallery quite as much as Storms
had been.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie Lee, the “leading Topsy,” for there were two
“Topsys” in the play, interested Frank more than anybody
else. Off the stage, she was a thin, frail, sad-faced little
girl, with a hollow, hacking cough. On the stage, she was
a supple, bright-eyed, lively, vivacious creature, dancing
and singing, as if she had not a care in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie’s father, old Dan Lee, played small parts, making
many changes. In fact, his skill at making quick
changes was something marvelous, and it was astonishing
how many different parts he could fill.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was said that old Dan knew every line in the piece,
and could play any male part. Some even insisted that
the old man in his palmy days had played “Little Eva,”
but Dan himself denied the accusation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Dan’s one failing was his strong liking for liquor.
But for Cassie’s watchful eyes, he would have been
“loaded” the greater part of the time, and lost his engagement
a dozen times a month. Cassie could handle him
unless he was crazed by liquor, and he was humble and
pliant in her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there were stories that on occasions old Dan took
too much and became like a maniac. Then even Cassie
could do nothing with him, and it was said that he had
once beaten her so severely while madly intoxicated that
she had been taken to the hospital, where she remained
six weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was said that through her father’s ill-treatment and
neglect Cassie’s health had been broken down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank wondered at the change that came over her every
night just before she went onto the stage. She suddenly
seemed to become quite a different creature. The lackluster
departed from her eyes, her step became elastic and
buoyant, and even her voice seemed to change.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this was a mystery to Merry at first, but, one night,
when she sent him to her dressing room for some article
she had forgotten, he made a discovery that enlightened
and horrified him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A small needle syringe lay on the shelf beside the square
mirror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Morphine!” gasped Frank. “That is the secret of the
change!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Cassie was a morphine fiend!</p>

<p class='c008'>The knowledge preyed on Frank’s mind. He pitied the
girl, and longed to do something for her, but he knew that
when the dreaded habit had once fairly fastened itself on
a victim that person was almost surely doomed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was very considerate with Cassie. He showed
her many favors, and he never minded her freaks and
whims when she was in a bad humor. As a result, after a
time, the girl began to take a great interest in Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Merriwell,” she said, one night as she was
“laying on” the burnt cork, “I cotton to you. You are the
right stuff, but you never ought to be in this business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?” asked Frank, surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Cause you ain’t the same grade as the rest of us.
That’s plain enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I quite understand you. Am I not good
enough to become an actor, if I wish?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie laughed unmusically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the matter with yer,” she declared. “You’re
too good. This kind of a life will ruin you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess yes, and I know what I’m talking about. I
hate to see a nice young man like you spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t let that worry you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think I’m jollying you, but I ain’t. I mean what
I say. Common actors are poor associates for such a fellow
as you are. You don’t drink, smoke or swear now,
but, if you stick to the road, I’ll bet a month’s salary you
are doing all three within a year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will not take your bet, for it would be robbing you,
Miss Lee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you believe yourself. I’d win. I know, for I’ve
seen what it all leads to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t suppose you mean to say the life depraves
everybody who follows it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not that; but it’s a hard strain on a fellow. This
knocking around just kills a person’s conscience. You’re
the kind that’ll be a soft thing for every bum who wants
to hit you up for a fiver. You will think they all mean to
pay when they can, but by the time you have been beat
right and left you’ll begin to get onto the game, and think
you may just as well play it in order to get even. That’s
what hurts. Borrow a five, and fail to pay it once, and
you’ve got your start on the wrong road. The keen edge
is taken off your conscience, and, before long, it gets
pretty dull. Oh, I know what I’m givin’ yer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well!” exclaimed Frank, surprised. “Never
thought I’d hear you preaching, Miss Lee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t call me Miss Lee! Don’t like it. I’m just plain
Cassie, or Cass, to all the boys.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, I’ll call you Cassie, then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do. Don’t tell the other fellers I lectured yer. They’d
say I’s getting soft. I don’t want Havener to know I take
enough interest in you to say anything like I did to yer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t want Havener to know it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well—because—you see him and me are—are—pretty
friendly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She blurted out the last two words, as if they cost her a
great effort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” said Frank, “I never noticed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Course you didn’t. We’re keeping it quiet, for Havener’s
got a wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, seeing the look that came over Frank’s face,
Cassie hastened to explain:</p>

<p class='c008'>“They ain’t lived together or ever heard from each
other for four years, and Havener’s going to get a divorce
as soon as he can for desertion. We couldn’t help gittin’
struck on each other, but I don’t want pop to know it till
Havener is free to marry me. That’s why we’re keeping
shady. But Storms was onto it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Storms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yep. Feller you kept from knocking the head offen
Havener.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! He——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was jealous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Then that——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was his real reason for cracking Ross that way,
though the others didn’t know it. He wanted me to marry
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Storms did?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you refused?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should guess yes! Roscoe Havener suits me. Him
and I’ll get along all right, and I’m glad Errol Storms is
out of the comp’ny. I was afraid of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Done me a good turn—yes. It was a good thing
when you jumped on that night and nipped Storms. I was
down in my dressin’ room when I heard Havener holler,
and I knew something was wrong, for that cry was too
real. I ran upstairs and got into the wings just in time
to see you and Storms have it. Then I came nigh giving
the whole thing away by getting sloppy over Ross, but I
pulled myself up just in time, and nobody got onto the
real reason why that business happened. I don’t know
why I told you, ’less it was ’cause I have been dying to
tell somebody about it, and I reckon you’ll keep your
mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may be sure I’ll not give you away, Miss—Cassie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right; but I’ve got something to tell you, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something more?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You want to look out not to let Ross get an idea you
take any particular interest in me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s jealous of you now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jealous of me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—why should he be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there ain’t no real reason, but he don’t know.
You’ve always been trying to do me favors, and his eyes
are sharp. He liked you at first, but now he is beginning
to growl to me. Says you are trying to know too much.
Says you’re fresh. Quizzes me about what I think of you,
and all that. I can read him, and I know he’s jealous, so
look out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sure I thank you for the warning,” said Frank,
embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s all right. He’ll get over it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you afraid of a jealous man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; I like him all the better for it. If you was some
chaps, I’d pretend to like you pretty well, just to see how
much he’d stand; but I don’t know what he’d do, and I
don’t want to get you into trouble. He has a pull with
Haley, and he might get you fired. I shouldn’t like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie had a frank way of speaking out that was decidedly
embarrassing, but she did not seem to imagine that
she had said something about which other girls would
have hesitated to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>This revelation opened Frank’s eyes to a great extent.
He understood thoroughly the real cause of the trouble
between Storms and Havener, and also why the latter’s
manner toward him had changed within a day or two.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must be careful,” Merry decided.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this talk with Cassie, Frank liked her and pitied
her more than ever. He wondered if Havener knew anything
of the terrible habit that had fastened itself on the
girl, and if he would marry her just the same should he
discover it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener’s first venture in marriage had not proved a
success, and his second one might result disastrously unless
Cassie could be cured of her liking for the fatal drug.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Merry felt certain the girl used morphine,
sometimes he would long to find that it was all a mistake.</p>

<p class='c008'>One night, however, it was all settled in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the theaters on the road contained but a few
small, dirty dressing rooms, so that it was necessary for
a number of persons to dress together in the same room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie was put in with two other girls at one place.
She did not “kick,” for she was used to everything on the
road.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she was not given much chance to be by herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as the curtain was going up on the first act, Frank
was sent down to the dressing room to get something for
one of the girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door was just a bit ajar, and Merry bolted in
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was an exclamation of consternation, echoed by
Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie was there. The sleeve of her left arm was thrust
back, showing white above the line of black at her wrist.
She was in the very act of using the little syringe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tiny instrument dropped from her fingers, and she
staggered back a step.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell!” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank started to turn away, then hastily explained why
he had come to the room. His manner told her he had
seen and understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here!” she hoarsely said, springing forward and
clutching him by the arm; “I want you to promise me
something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you’ll keep mum.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can trust me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t tell Havener?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you do it on your life! I’m going to stop it—some
time. I want to see you after the play to-night. I
want to talk to you. I’ll tell you all about it. Go on, now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He secured the article he was after, and she pushed him
out of the room, closing and fastening the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the little syringe was recharged and used.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>THE JEALOUS STAGE-MANAGER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>There was now no doubt in Frank’s mind; he knew
Cassie used the drug, and his heart was full of pity for
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night, after the play was over, Cassie lingered in
the dressing room, slowly picking up her things. The
other girls were ready to leave, and they called for her to
hurry up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, go on,” she said. “I’ll be along pretty soon.
Don’t wait for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So they started for their hotel, leaving her there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was at work getting the properties together and
packing them in one of the dressing rooms, while Havener
was above on the stage, looking after the special scenery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie found Frank and came in on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” she said, in a dull, dejected way, “I’ve got
a few things I want to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was uneasy, but he stopped working, saying, respectfully:</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Cassie; I’ll listen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you blow on me, I’m done for.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now don’t be afraid that I will blow. What put such
a notion into your head?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t know but you’d be doing the right thing
if you did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, because it might not be right for any man to hitch
up with a girl like me. If Havener knew——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think he’d go back on you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t tell. His other wife drank like a fish, and he
quit her. That ain’t so bad as what I do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you, Cassie—how in the world did you ever contract
such a habit?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got it in the hospital.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that is how?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she faltered, as if she found it difficult to choose
her words. “You know—I—was hurt. I went to the hospital.
They had to inject morphine to keep down the pain.
When I came out I kept on using it once in a while.
After a time I used it oftener, and now——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t seem to shake it. I’ve tried, but it’s no use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She said this sadly, dejectedly, and Frank’s heart was
stirred by a great sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m going to break it off some time—I will if I
die!” she declared, fiercely. “I have sworn it! It’s the
only thing left for me, and I must do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you are talking right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I ain’t a fool, Frank Merriwell! I know well
enough what I’ve got to do. The thing is to do it. One
night I tried to play ‘Topsy’ without using it, but I was so
dull and dead that Haley gave me a great call down. It
puts life into me, it braces me up long enough to play the
part. If I don’t do it, I’ll lose my engagement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better lose your engagement than your health—your
life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I can’t afford to lay off now,” said Cassie, desperately.
“I must go through till the end of the season.
Then I’m going to a sanitarium somewhere and get rid
of this business—get cured. I’ll do it! All I want is for
you to keep still.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can trust me,” assured Merry. “You may be
sure I’ll keep still.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t tell Havener.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A man came quickly into the room. It was Havener
himself, and his scowling face showed he had overheard
something.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie gave a gasp of terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage-manager glared at them both.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this secret between you that you are going to
keep from me?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Speak!” cried Havener, furiously. “It’s no use trying
to keep the thing hidden, for I am dead on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie looked at Frank appealingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now don’t take a lot of time to think up something to
say,” snarled the angry man. “It won’t go down with
me! I’ve seen how things were going for some time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he whirled madly on the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’re stuck on him because he’s young and smart!
Well, you may make a fool of yourself! He’ll throw you
over after a time. You have made a fool of me already!
Oh, I’d like to——”</p>

<p class='c008'>His clinched fist was drawn back, and he seemed on the
point of striking her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank leaped forward and caught the man’s wrist.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a howl, Havener turned and struck at Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Quick as he was, Frank dodged the blow. Then he
grappled with the stage-manager, strong as that person
was, ran him up against the partition, and held him there,
helpless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen a moment, Mr. Havener,” he said, with remarkable
calmness; “you are making a blithering idiot of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t lie——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not lying. There is no affair between Miss Lee
and myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The secret——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall keep. All the same, you have no reason in the
world to be jealous. I swear it. If you will permit, I’ll
gladly be your friend and Miss Lee’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please don’t hurt him, Merriwell!” entreated Cassie,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those words made Havener squirm. He felt the disgrace
of being handled thus easily by a beardless youth.
At the same time, he was filled with admiration and astonishment
because of Frank’s strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not injure him,” promised Frank; “but he must
come to his senses before I let him go. He must promise
not to act like a fool.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let go,” said Havener. “I was a fool to get stuck on
the girl! Said I’d never let another one fool me after my
first mistake, but a man don’t know much when it comes
to women.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will make a fool of yourself if you break with
Miss Lee because you think there is anything between us,
that’s sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What was the secret?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps she will tell you some day. If you care for
her, you must believe in her and trust her. If you cannot
trust her now, it will be a good thing for her to break with
you right here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow those words seemed to take the excitement
out of the stage-manager. He looked at Frank, and then
his eyes wandered to the face of the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must believe him, Ross,” she said. “He is right.
If you can’t trust me now, you never will, and we shall
be miserable, instead of happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He knows——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything. I have told him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I had to tell somebody! You are a man, and
you can keep still, but a woman just has to talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is ready to help us, instead of trying to make
trouble between us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me go,” urged Havener. “Let me think it over.
Perhaps I have been foolish. I don’t know. I’ll have to
have time to think about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank released him, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, but don’t get daffy about it. Believe me—believe
Miss Lee. All will be well in the end, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were talking together in a confidential way,” said
the stage-manager, “and I heard her ask you not to tell
me about something. That was enough to make any man
suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps so; but you had better forget it.” Frank went
about his work, leaving Cassie talking earnestly with
Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was evident to Merry that she finally satisfied him
that his jealousy was groundless, for he stooped and
kissed her suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Frank’s heart, however, was a deep and heavy pain,
caused by the knowledge of the unfortunate girl’s terrible
secret.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>TWO “ANGELS.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The “All-Star Combination” struck bad business and a
run of all-around hard luck. The “ghost” did not “walk,”
and distrust, dissension and rebellion arose. Barnaby
Haley had all he could do to hold the company together.
He did so, hoping that the “streak” would pass and good
business would come.</p>

<p class='c008'>The part of the country through which they were playing
had been surfeited with “Uncle Tom,” and the people
were tired of the old piece, so they refused to be aroused
and inveigled into giving up their hard-earned money, for
all of the glaring paper, the donkey, the “fierce bloodhounds,”
and the “gold band.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One night there was a “council of war” among the
members of the company, and demands were made on
Haley. He could not meet the demands, and the entire
company threatened to “quit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The following morning several members of the company
were missing, and the show was forced to go on
without them, or suspend.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night old Dan Lee filled more parts than he had
ever before attempted on one occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to get through with the piece, it was necessary
for almost every actor to “fake,” and Frank was obliged
to fill in by assuming a small part. He did it very well,
saving the piece from complete disaster, although the thin
audience went away far from satisfied.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the next town was reached, it was found that
their reputation had reached there in advance of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be lucky if we take ten dollars to-night,” declared
Havener, after discovering the true state of affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then one of the actresses “struck,” adding to the complications.
It seemed doubtful if they could play that
night at all, but, as a last, dying gasp, they resolved to
make a bluff at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The actress had been required each night to ascend into
the flies as the spirit of “Little Eva” after the death scene,
and it was necessary for some other person to take her
place.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night it was arranged that Hans should dress in
the flowing white robes, and be hoisted into the flies when
the proper time came. The stage would be in semidarkness,
and it was hoped that the audience would not catch
on.</p>

<p class='c008'>This struck Frank as very ludicrous. Merry believed
the dissolution of the company must come on the following
day, and so he was ready to play any sort of a practical
joke. He resolved to have some sport at the Dutch lad’s
expense.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the astonishment of everybody, the theater filled
surprisingly with spectators. Barnaby Haley rubbed his
hands together with satisfaction and congratulated himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the audience was there for sport, and they began
almost as soon as the curtain went up to guy the players.
As the play progressed, this “jollying” became more and
more offensive and hard to bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank decided that, before the play was over, the
audience would break out all together.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the death scene came, Hans Dunnerwurst, arrayed
in white robes, with wings attached to his shoulders,
was crouching behind the couch on which “Little Eva”
was supposed to be gasping her last.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had arranged the tackle that was to hoist Hans,
and he was waiting eagerly for the climax that was to
come.</p>

<p class='c008'>It came.</p>

<p class='c008'>The footlights refused to grow dim, although a desperate
attempt was made to lower them, and there was a
hitch in the play.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, thoroughly desperate, Havener gave the signal
for the men at the windlass to hoist away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something white rose swiftly into the air over the
couch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “spirit of Little Eva” was ascending.</p>

<p class='c008'>But such a spirit!</p>

<p class='c008'>The hook of the tackle was attached to the seat of the
Dutch lad’s trousers, so that he was held limply “amidships,”
while his flowing robes had fallen away in such a
manner that his clothing was exposed beneath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Probably never before in the history of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” on the stage had such a “spirit” ascended before
the eyes of a staring, astounded audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell-up!” howled Hans, kicking and squawking, as he
sailed toward the flies. “Come und safe me pefore you
vos a deat man!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there was a hitch, for the windlass refused to
work, and there the struggling Dutch lad hung in full
view of the now laughing spectators.</p>

<p class='c008'>Missiles began to whizz through the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spat!—a stale egg struck Hans behind the ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whizz—plunk!</p>

<p class='c008'>A small cabbage sent him spinning round and round
like a top.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nail him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Soak him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it to him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hooray!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience was in an uproar, and it seemed as if every
person there had brought something to throw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hel-lup!” bellowed the unfortunate lad. “I vos peing
kilt alretty yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With the band, Ephraim Gallup roared with laughter.
He knew a practical joke had been perpetrated, and
somehow it had the flavor of Frank Merriwell’s old-time
larks, so he was immensely amused.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Hans stopped revolving for a moment, he shook his
fist at Ephraim, gurgling:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vait, vait! Uf I aind’t kilt pefore I die, I vill got
efen mit you! You vos a——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swat!—a rotten apple struck him fairly in the mouth,
stopping his flow of speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the funniest show I ever seen!” shouted a man
in the audience. “Ain’t I glad I come!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Some boys began to sing “I Want to Be an Angel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the windlass began to work again, and the pelted
youth was drawn up out of sight, just as Havener succeeded
in arousing the curtain boy to let the curtain down.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not necessary to finish the play. The audience
did not expect it, and the theater was emptied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans Dunnerwurst was so angry that he couldn’t talk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener did not have much to say, for he decided that
it would be a waste of words, for the company was pretty
sure to disband on the following day.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night the stage-manager accompanied Cassie Lee
when she left the theater. It was dark on the side street,
and a man sprang on them almost as soon as they came
out by the stage entrance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I’ve caught ye together!” snarled a familiar voice.
“I’ll finish you both this time!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Storms!” screamed the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Storms!” grated the man. “Take that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That” was a bullet from a revolver aimed straight at
Cassie.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the bullet did not touch her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell had followed them from the building,
and he leaped on their assailant, bearing Storms to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>The revolver was discharged again, and Frank felt the
powder singe his wrist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Havener came to Frank’s aid, and, between them,
they disarmed and captured the ruffian, beating him into a
stunned condition with the butt of his own revolver.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night Storms lay in the town’s “cooler,” and on
the following day he was tried for murderous assault and
held for the grand jury.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener and Cassie promised to appear against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage-manager went to Frank, like a man, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell, I don’t know what the secret is between
you and Cassie, and I don’t want to know till you get ready
to tell me, but I want to ask your pardon for making a fool
of myself over it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” assured Frank. “I had forgotten
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hadn’t. I could hate you even if you did save my
life, but since you saved Cassie’s, I can hate you no
longer. I believe Storms’ first shot would have killed her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bore him down just in time. Keep the secret, and
be my friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held out his hand, which Frank grasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” said Merry; “I am glad to be your friend.
As for the secret, some day Cassie will tell you that
herself. We may part here, but I wish you good fortune.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Part?” said Havener. “I hope not. Haley has struck
an angel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An angel—a chap with money who will back the show.
We are going to reorganize and go on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurrah!” cried Frank. “That is good news!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK IS GIVEN A PART.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>A few weeks later Frank was startled by a request
to take a part himself owing to the illness of one of the
actors. The request came from the stage-manager of the
“Empire Theater Comedy Company,” which was, in fact,
the reorganized “All-Star Combination,” formerly on the
road playing a “modernized version” of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” This play was now simply one of the numerous
pieces in the repertory of the reorganized company, the
donkey and the bloodhounds being relegated to the background
for the time being, although the famous “Gold
Band” was retained in all its glory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley believed in the efficacy of a band of
music to draw spectators in small cities and country towns.
He rated it next to “paper” in the general run, and even
better in some cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for “paper,” three of the pieces in the repertory
were “old stand-bys,” and “stock paper” could be obtained
for them from any of the big eastern theatrical printing
houses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley had retained his grip on the management of the
company, although obliged to take in a partner. The
partner was the “angel” who saved the company from going
to pieces. His name was Zenas Hawkins, a man with
theatrical ambitions, who had “money to burn.” Haley
was helping him burn it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley realized that “Uncle Tom” had been done to death
through the section of the country he was in, and so the
reorganized company prepared to put on several other
pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of those plays they could obtain legitimately.
Others were secured from a certain company of “pirates,”
located in Chicago, who boasted that they could supply
any dramas on the American or English stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>These plays were secured by the “pirates” with the assistance
of expert shorthand writers, who were hired to
attend them and take down the lines as spoken by the different
actors. From these shorthand notes typewritten
manuscript copies of the plays were made, and sold for
sums ranging from five to twenty-five dollars, to such unscrupulous
managers as cared to purchase and use them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, this traffic in stolen property was unlawful.
The manager who purchased and produced the play was
committing a crime, but, until recently, the penalty was
simply a fine, usually insignificant when exacted, and the
manager could jump on to some other part of the country
and go right ahead playing the piece. In nine cases out of
ten he would not have money enough to pay the fine, and
it cost the rightful owners of the piece more trouble and
money to prosecute him than they could afford, as such
prosecution seldom or never interfered more than temporarily
with the pirating of the play.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the amended copyright law of 1895, however,
any manager unlawfully presenting a play is liable to a
fine of not less than one hundred dollars for the first performance
and fifty dollars for each subsequent performance;
and offenders who fail to pay the fines imposed
may be imprisoned upon order of the court.</p>

<p class='c008'>This revised law has, in a measure, stopped the pirating
of plays, although the fact that the rascally concern in
Chicago is still doing business is evidence that there are
unscrupulous managers in the country who are willing to
take desperate chances in order to play in remote and
unfrequented towns the popular dramas of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley had decided to take such chances, for he
had obtained three plays in manuscript from the Chicago
thieves. The titles of these plays, however, he had
changed, to reduce the liability of detection, and he had
resolved to be very careful where he presented them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, there was no paper for these pieces, but the
advertising for the other plays was good enough to attract
attention at the start, and the stolen plays would be presented
to wind up full week engagements, where a change
of bill was required nightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley had induced Hawkins to “put up” for one “full
stand” of printed advertising, made especially for them,
and that was “pretty good stuff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the selection of a name for the organization, the
crafty and astute Mr. Haley had remembered that there
was an “Empire Theater Stock Company,” the fame of
which had spread extensively. By calling his aggregation
the “Empire Theater Comedy Company” he fancied many
people might be deceived into believing it the organization
of a similar name, which was handled and controlled by a
wonderfully successful theatrical manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roscoe Havener, the former stage-manager, had been
retained in his old capacity, for he was a good man and
knew his business.</p>

<p class='c008'>The company had played three days in a town where
they were billed to remain for a week, when, one afternoon
just before rehearsal, Havener sought Frank Merriwell
and requested him to take the place of Mr. Lawrence,
who was dangerously ill.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were on the stage, which was set for the first
act of the play to be given that night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several of the other members of the company, attired
for a dress rehearsal, were present and heard what was
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of them, a young man, Douglas Dunton, who
played the scheming villain of the piece, listened with
great interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leslie Lawrence, the actor who was ill, had been cast for
the leading character of the play, a part Dunton had coveted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You, Merriwell,” said the stage-manager, “must play
the part given to Lawrence. The local stage-manager will
have to serve as prompter to-night, and every member of
the company must, so far as possible, look after the properties
required by him or her. We must get through with
this piece somehow, even if you have to read Lawrence’s
part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It strikes me, Havener,” he said, in his forward way,
“that you can make a better arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ross Havener turned and scowled at the speaker, for he
was a man who did not fancy receiving suggestions from
anyone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” he said, sharply, like a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton repeated his words in a bold manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” asked the stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It strikes me that it is a mistake to put Merriwell, a raw
amateur, onto such a part,” said Dunton, swiftly. “He
cannot memorize the lines in such a short time, and he is
bound to make an awful mess of the whole play if he tries
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank said not a word, but his eyes looked the speaker
straight through.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener turned to Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think you can do anything at all with the part in such
a short time?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can try,” was the quiet answer. “I am very apt at
memorizing anything, and I believe I can have the greater
part of the lines before the evening performance, if I am
not required to do anything else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even if he had the lines perfectly,” put in Dunton,
“he could not handle the part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know?” asked the stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reason will tell anybody that. Why, it is almost a
star part! It requires some one with experience and judgment.
I have studied the part, for I like it, and I believe
I can play it as it should be played. It is the kind of a
part that suits me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum!” grunted Havener. “What are you driving at?
Want to play it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I believe that would be the best way to arrange
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’d fill your part?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might put Merriwell on that. It is only about
half as long as the other, and it does not make so much
difference if it is not played well. The audience hates the
villain, anyway, and so what’s the odds if he is rank?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that is the way you feel about your part, is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; I haven’t liked it from the start.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener drew himself up, and his black eyes glared
at Dunton.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, sir!” he exploded; “you are not capable of playing
the part as it should be acted, much less a better part,
like that given Lawrence! The trouble with you is that
you have an enlarged head. I advise you to put it in soak
and see if you can’t reduce its size. Get such notions out
of your nut, or I shall have to put you onto juveniles. You
will play the part assigned to you, and Mr. Merriwell will
do his best with the part I gave Lawrence. That settles
it, and I don’t want to hear any more about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener turned away, and Douglas Dunton, furious
over such a “call down,” gave Frank Merriwell a look of
hatred, but remained silent.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>CASSIE, THE SOUBRETTE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Frank was given the manuscript of the play, and he began
looking the part over at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had a wonderful memory, and he put his mind onto
the lines in such a manner that he did not hear Cassie Lee,
the soubrette, till she had spoken to him three times.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to bother you, Frank,” she said, “but accept
my congratulations, and I hope you’ll just paralyze
’em to-night. Somehow I believe you will astonish ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall do my best, Cassie,” said Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it,” nodded Cassie, an unusually animated
light coming to her eyes. “I heard what Dunton said, and
I was mighty glad Ross gave him that call down. Dunton
is a flub, but he’s got a bad temper, and he’ll hate you
worse than sin now. Look out for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He won’t trouble me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you be too sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I shan’t worry about it. I’m not afraid of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just it. You’ll be too careless. I wouldn’t trust
him as fur as I could sling a mule by the tail. I don’t like
his eyes. They’re too shifty. He alwus struck me as
treacherous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he must hate Havener worse than he does me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He won’t dare touch Ross, and that’s the very reason
why he may try all the harder to do you. My! but I wish
this old rehearsal was over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a dog.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This business of playing so many different parts is too
much for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s work, but I like it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better than playing ‘Topsy’ regularly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure. I was dead sick of that old part. I’m glad
‘Uncle Tom’ is only played once in a while, but pop is
heartbroken.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’d rather stick to the old piece?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord, yes! He’s been playin’ parts in it for the last
twenty years, and he knows every line and every bit of
business. He thinks the country is degenerating when
people get stuffed with ‘Uncle Tom’ and don’t want no
more of him. He wouldn’t stay with the company if it
wasn’t for me, and he’s liable to break loose any time and
get on a reg’l’r tear. I’m watching him all the time and
hold him down. Pop is all right when he lets red-eye
alone, but he’s worse’n an Indian when he gets on a tear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will be able to keep him straight, Cassie;
but this watching is wearing on you. You don’t get rest
enough, and you show it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shot him a quick look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It ain’t that so much,” she muttered. “It’s something
else the most. You know what ails me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know,” admitted Frank. “Can’t you break
away from the habit, Cassie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How can I? Look at me! I’m dull as a rainstorm, my
head feels like a block of wood, and my feet are like lead.
Wouldn’t I be in nice shape to go on before a house?
Time I did it twice, Haley’d fire me, and he wouldn’t be to
blame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But isn’t there anything else——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope. Got to use the same old stuff till the season’s
over anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it’s getting an awful hold on you, Cassie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hard lines formed round her mouth—a mouth that
had once been rather sweet and pretty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t help it,” she said, grimly. “It wasn’t my fault
in the first place, and I’ve got to live. All summer there
won’t be nothing for me to do, and I must stick the season
out, so as to have something saved up for hot weather. I
tell you, this life ain’t what it’s cracked up to be. A girl
that’s got a good home and wants to go on the stage is a
fool. She don’t know when she’s well off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank nodded his conviction that this was true. He had
not seen much of theatrical life, but already he was convinced
that it was a hard life to follow, especially for a
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was brought up to it,” Cassie went on; “and that was
just my hard luck. Never had no good chance to get an
education.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can educate yourself now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No use,” she said. “I’m too old now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too old! Why, how old are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only eighteen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s enough. Most girls are ready to leave school
when they’re that old.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank did not tell her, but he had fancied that she was
twenty-three or twenty-four. He now realized that it was
the life she had led that had made her seem so much older
than she was in truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Life on the stage in cheap dramatic companies that play
one-night stands is hard at best; but Cassie’s life had been
particularly hard on account of her father, who had neglected
and abused her when he drank.</p>

<p class='c008'>For all of this neglect and abuse, Merry believed old
Dan Lee really loved his daughter, for, when the man was
sober, he was proud of Cassie, being tender and considerate
in all his actions toward her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Dan was very jealous of her. He believed her too
good to “tie up” to a common ham-fatter, and so he had
blocked the game of every cheap actor who tried to show
her particular attentions. He believed that, some day, she
would be able to make a “good match,” for other men
must see in her all the fine qualities that were so evident
to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it came about that the girl did not dare let her
father know there was a love affair between herself and
Roscoe Havener, the stage-manager, for, although Havener
had not seen his legal wife for four years, he was not
divorced, and the entire company knew it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Frank discovered this attachment between the
soubrette and the stage-manager he felt like advising
Cassie to wait a while before she permitted herself to become
very fond of Havener, but he quickly decided that
such advice would be a waste of words, and kept still.</p>

<p class='c008'>That Havener was favorably disposed toward Merriwell,
Cassie felt sure, even though he had said little or
nothing about the young man. Now, after seeing him
give Merry the part that had been assigned to Lawrence,
who was really one of the best actors in the troupe, and
hearing him call down Dunton, she was certain Havener
was aiming for one of two things. Either he had confidence
in Merriwell, and wished to give him a chance to
show up, or he believed Frank must make a wretched
failure in attempting to play on such short notice, which
would mean his “release” from the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie had such confidence in Frank that she believed
that Havener would fail if he was aiming to disgrace
Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wished to encourage Merry, and that was why she
had spoken to him as he was sitting on a canvas-covered
property tree stump, industriously and hurriedly running
over his lines in the first act.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’re only eighteen, you’ve got plenty of time to
study and add to your education, Cassie,” said Frank.
“You have a way of learning your lines quickly when you
take a part. You can read the right kind of books and
memorize their contents.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what kind of books to read.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, I’ll think it over. I don’t have much time,
you know. Can’t do it after the show is over, for I’m
dead tired by that time. Can’t do it forenoons, for I’m
digging away on new parts all the time now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you can do it vacations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I suppose I might. There, I’ve bothered you too
much. Didn’t mean to when I spoke to you. Just wanted
to tell you I’d bet anything you surprise ’em on the part
to-night. Something makes me sure you will. You have
lots of lines with me, and I know them lines as well as I
do my own. If you get stuck, I’ll be able to give you a lift
without the aid of the prompter. Keep your nerve; don’t
get the shakes. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The shakes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stage fright?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know, but I hardly think I’ll have that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ever have it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did I! I should guess yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thought you were brought up on the stage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I don’t see why you should have stage fright.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a mighty funny thing, I tell you. I began as an
infant prodigy, and I don’t s’pose anything ever scared me
till I was playing soubrette parts. One night I got it, just
as hard. Opened my mouth to speak, and, by George! I
couldn’t make a sound. I just stood there like I was
nailed to the boards. Pretty quick I began to shake, and
you’d thought I was taken with the ague. It was terrible,
I thought I’d faint. After a while, I got strength enough
to rush off, and then I had fits in one of the dressing
rooms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was strange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. ’Most ev’rybody gets a touch of it sooner or later.
When it was all over, I was so hopping mad I didn’t know
what to do. I went on again and played right through the
piece without a quiver, and I’ve never had a touch of it
since. But I had to have it some time. Some people never
get over it fully, but with most folks, one attack ends it.
I hope you won’t have it to-night, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll git. ’Scuse me for the bother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked away, and Frank followed her sympathetically
with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As good-hearted girl as ever lived,” he murmured.
“It’s a shame she’s contracted that frightful habit. I’m
afraid it has such a hold on her that she’ll never be able
to get rid of it. Poor Cassie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he resumed his studying.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>THE REHEARSAL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>By this time the band, which had given its midday
parade through the town at the regular hour, was gathered
before the stage, ready to practice the pieces to be
played that evening.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup had managed to retain his position in
the band, as he was a remarkably good baritone player,
and he had a way of making his horn “talk” so that it
pleased the ear of the average countryman mightily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans Dunnerwurst, the Dutch boy, had developed a
knack for playing the bass drum, so he was retained by
Manager Haley. Hans played the drum and cymbals at
the same time, beating the drum with his right hand and
playing the cymbals with his left, one of the brass discs
being attached to the drum so that the other could be struck
against it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The leader of the band had a great idea of the proper
music for a street parade and for an inclosure like the interior
of a hall or theater. On the street the little band of
eight pieces roared and thundered in an amazing manner,
making enough noise for four times their number. It was
not noise without harmony, either; and it was the kind
of music that pleased all small boys and most men and
women.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the band was a quartet of fine singers. Each night
the band played in front of the theater just before the
doors were opened. The final piece in the open air was one
that always pleased the fancy of the listeners, as it was
replete with all kinds of musical tricks. It contained a
cornet solo, into which some imitation bugle calls were
worked, a snare drum solo, during which, for a few seconds,
the drummer rattled away on the side of his drum,
instead of the head; a trombone solo, giving the trombone
player a chance to do some fancy flourishing, and, at one
point in the piece, every other instrument stopped for the
bass drum and cymbals to rattle, and bang, and thunder,
and crash. But the real catching features of the piece
came toward the end. Of a sudden every instrument
stopped, and the entire band whistled a strain of the piece.
Then it was that Hans Dunnerwurst made his great hit,
for he was a marvelous whistler, and he warbled and trilled
in a way that made it seem a whole flock of mocking-birds
had broken loose, and caused the spectators to stand on
their toes and crane their necks to see who was producing
all those amazing sounds. The final feature of this piece
was singing by the quartet, and when it was all over
the crowd almost invariably broke into a tumult of applause,
and the astute Mr. Haley rushed the band off the
scene, knowing anything more would be too much, as the
crowd had been worked up to just the proper pitch to
part with its quarters and halves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The music provided by the band inside the hall was of
quite a different character. It was soft and subdued, full
of rippling melody, and quite suited to the situation. Of
course, the medley was given in the evening, as it was
almost always called for by the audience, and some new
features were introduced, such as sleighbells, tinkling
cymbals and the shuffleboard to imitate dancing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the musicians acted as accompanists for the
singing given at each performance, and furnished music
for the dancing, so they were required to rehearse with
the company regularly. Indeed, Havener was quite a
stickler about the matter of rehearsals, no one being excused
from them without good cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>The band played through one of its new pieces, and
then, in order to give Merriwell more time to run over his
part, Havener had the singers go through with their
songs for the evening performance.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Frank was so utterly absorbed in his effort to
commit as many lines as possible that he did not even
notice when the rehearsal began.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, the time for him to go on arrived, and Havener
appeared at his elbow, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you can get along at the start without the manuscript,
Merriwell, it will be better. I’ll take it and help
you along. We’ve managed to go this far without a
prompter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank did not stir. He sat with his eyes fastened on the
page before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener touched his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, Merriwell,” he said, sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Frank was aroused, and he got up quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he spoke. “I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He handed the manuscript to Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think you can do anything without reading?” asked
the stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I can remember a part of the first act.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right; go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank went on, and Havener observed that he made the
proper entrance. He had an “enter speech,” and he gave
it correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton was standing in the wings, watching and
sneering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener went down into the theater in front of the
stage, where he could watch the rehearsing and see that
the characters went through their business properly and
grouped themselves to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup and Hans Dunnerwurst were astonished,
for they had not known that Frank was to play a
part.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shimminy Gristmas!” gurgled Hans.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh all hemlock!” gasped Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank knew everyone was watching him, which made
his position extremely embarrassing. Indeed, for a professional
rehearsals are often far more trying than performances
when the theater is well filled with people. It
is difficult to act before empty seats, with the members
of the company looking on, for then the intensity required
at certain times seems foolish, and makes the performer
feel ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry’s face was flushed, and he stammered somewhat
at first. Then he heard a low, sneering laugh, and he saw
Dunton regarding him derisively.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly Frank stiffened up. He was on his mettle in
a moment, resolved to do his best, and he got through the
scene fairly well. Of course, Havener had to prompt him
several times and give him directions about certain business.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the stage-manager observed with satisfaction that
Merriwell made a good appearance and did not assume
any awkward positions, get back to the footlights, or turn
in the wrong direction when it was necessary to cross, go
up or walk away from another person.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Frank came off, Cassie was waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good stuff!” she declared, approvingly. “You did
that all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it was pretty bad,” confessed Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you it was all right. Surely you did remember
those lines well. Got any more?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I can remember nearly all of the first act.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you can do that, you’re a wonder!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank did it. In fact, when he went on again, he was
almost letter perfect. This time much of his business was
with Dunton, who continued to wear a sneering expression
on his face and did whatever he could to break Merry up.
In this the young rascal failed, for Frank acquitted himself
splendidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The instant the end of the act was reached, Havener
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll go through that again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The third act is the heavy one,” said Dunton. “I
think we’ll have to go over that more than once, and we
won’t have time if we repeat the first act.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage-manager gave the fellow a withering stare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Dunton,” he exclaimed, “if you are managing
this business, I’ll quit; if you are not, kindly permit
me to give directions. That’s all. We will repeat the first
act.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The angry actor ground his teeth together and stalked
off. Behind the scenes he found his especial chum, Arthur
Sargent, and gave vent to his feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is too much!” he snarled, guardedly. “Havener
gives that upstart Merriwell the leading part in the piece,
and then he calls me down twice before the fellow. I feel
like punching somebody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Punch Merriwell,” suggested Sargent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All I want is a good opportunity,” declared Dunton.
“I’d like to get at him. I’d do him up in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow had a reputation as a “scrapper,” and he
fully believed he could whip Merriwell easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can find an opportunity,” said Sargent. “I’d like
to see you spoil his face. He thinks he’s handsome, and a
pair of black eyes would break his heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll give them to him,” promised Frank’s new enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’ll make an awful mess of the whole play! Just
think of him in the duel scene with me! And I’ve got to
let him disarm me and get the best of the duel! Gods!
it’s enough to make a man daffy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The whole business will be a farce,” Sargent consolingly
declared. “Havener will be to blame for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right. I’d like to tell Havener what I think of
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why don’t you do it!” exclaimed another voice,
and Cassie Lee suddenly appeared from behind some loose
scenery. “I’d like to see you! I’ll bet you don’t dare
peep to him, but you raise a big blow behind his back.
You’re a stiff! That’s my opinion of you, Dug Dunton!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The soubrette was aroused now, and her accustomed
languid, weary air had vanished completely. Her eyes,
generally dull and heavy, except when she had resorted to
the stimulation of morphine, were full of fire and scorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sargent gasped and seemed to feel like sneaking away,
but Dunton brazened it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you were playing eavesdropper, hey?” he hissed.
“Well, I don’t care! If you blow on me to Havener, I’ll
give you away to your old man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie threw back her head, and her thin nostrils dilated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give me away?” she panted. “About what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you know,” asserted Dunton, with insolent significance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me what you mean!” commanded the little soubrette,
bracing up to him, her small fists clinched. “Tell
me what you mean, Dug Dunton, or I’ll light onto you
myself, and I’ll bet a dollar I can make you look pretty
sick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw she really meant what she threatened, and he
backed off a step, putting up his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Easy now!” he fluttered. “Don’t make a fool of yourself,
Cassie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me what you meant by your words. What will
you give away?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I meant that I’d tell Dan about you being so
thick with Havener. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s enough! What do you mean by ‘so thick’?
What do you know, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I know a few things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ve been rubber-necking. Well, it’s just like
you. I believe I have a right to be friendly with Mr.
Havener?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; but you don’t want your father to know just how
friendly, and I don’t fancy you care to have the rest of the
company know it. You keep still about me, for I can hurt
you if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’d try to hurt my character, would you? Well,
I never thought any better of you. But you do it if you
dare! If you say one word about me that is bad, I’ll
shoot you full of holes! If you blow your mouth to pop,
I’ll have your hide and tan it for shoe leather! Don’t you
forgit it, either! And I advise you to keep away from
Frank Merriwell, for he can lick the stuffing out of you
the best day you ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton nearly lost his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—why,” he gasped, “you’re crazy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope, just mad—blazin’ mad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Merriwell gives me any guff, you’ll see——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He never gives anybody guff, but he’ll give you a
thrashing if you get gay with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can whip him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes you can—I don’t think!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a stiff!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s too stiff for you. He’s a gentleman, and you ain’t
in his class. You know it, and that’s what ails you. I
don’t propose to waste any more breath on you, for you
ain’t worth it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Cassie walked away, leaving Dunton shaking with
rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to wring her neck!” he panted. “I never liked
her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jingoes!” ejaculated Sargent. “Never thought there
was so much fire in that pale-faced, washed-out creature.
She always reminded me of Kipling’s poem, ‘A rag and
a bone and a hank of hair.’ You better keep still about
her, Dug, for something makes me think she’d keep her
word and shoot you if you said anything about her character.
Such girls as she are liable to do such things; and
you know you actually do not know anything detrimental
to her, except that she is stuck on Havener.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, she’s a fool! What makes me the hottest is that
she thinks that upstart Merriwell can do me. I’ll show
her about that, if I get a chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton was still agitated with anger when it was necessary
for him to go on the stage again, and he went
through his part in such an indifferent manner that Havener
was obliged to speak to him several times. This the
stage-manager did quietly, for he saw the actor was
“broken up,” and he believed it was because of the calling
down he had received.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Merriwell, he went through his work with a vim
and assurance that simply amazed everybody. This time
he seemed to have his lines almost perfectly, and the act
went off smoothly so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the second act was taken up and rushed through.
As everyone but Merry had his or her lines almost perfectly,
there was no absolute necessity of prompting, and
Frank was given a chance to run over his speeches when
he was not on the stage. When he did go on, he again
astonished them all by the number of lines he could say
correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the third act came the duel scene between Merry and
Dunton. In the duel, Frank was to get the worst of it at
first, to be wounded by a foul thrust, and then to disarm
his antagonist and generously decline to retaliate
for his injury.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just before the duel scene, Frank heard Dunton say to
another member of the company:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think of being disarmed by such a stiff as that fellow!
It will be ridiculous, and the chances are that the
audience will throw things at us to-night. Probably he
never saw a sword before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry’s first thought was to show the fellow without delay
that he was greatly mistaken. Then came another
thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll let him think away till to-night,” decided Frank;
“and then I’ll try to give him a surprise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he went on for the duel scene and carried it through
in a decidedly awkward manner, so that Havener was
obliged to come upon the stage and try to show him how
to handle his sword and follow out the idea of the duel
properly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton looked disgusted. As they were going through
the duel for the seventh time, he whispered just loud
enough for Frank to hear:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a regular stick! You’ll make a holy show of
us both to-night!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know,” murmured the new actor. “Wait
till to-night comes. I may be able to do it better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bah! you make me sick!” retorted Dunton, through
his white teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may make you sicker still,” said Merry, with a
soothing smile. “You are not nearly as many as you
imagine you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow looked as if he longed to fly at Merriwell
on the instant, but he simply ground his teeth together
and glared, which caused the stage-manager to compliment
him:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you are getting into the part, Dunton,” said
Havener. “That expression on your face is fine. It’s
exactly what you want in that scene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton swore under his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell, too, has a good expression,” declared the
stage-manager. “That calm, confident smile is all right.
I confess that I was afraid of this scene, but I rather
think it will go off all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the rehearsal went on to the end, Havener not
allowing them to stop till it was time to go to the hotel
for supper.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>DUNTON SEEKS REVENGE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The most of the company got out of the theater as soon
as possible after being given permission to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank remained to receive some instructions from
Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>After giving Merry a few pointers, the stage-manager
observed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did surprisingly well this afternoon, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you get stuck to-night for the exact lines, do you
think you can fake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, don’t try it if there is any chance of getting off
your trolley and mixing yourself and everybody else.
Faking lines is a dangerous and reprehensible practice,
and the resort of lazy actors who will not learn their
parts; but there are times when faking cannot very well be
avoided, and the ability to do it well on such occasions is
worth much to a man. Don’t try it to-night, Merriwell,
unless you have some idea of the real gist of your speech
and feel certain you can finish by giving the next speaker
the proper cue.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener looked at Frank doubtfully, and then suddenly
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t get the swelled head, but if you do as well in
playing to-night as you did at rehearsing this afternoon,
you’ll show yourself a wonder. I don’t often say anything
like this to anybody, but somehow I felt that it
might encourage you without doing you any harm, and I
want to give you all the encouragement possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you again,” came simply from Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see how you committed so many lines by simply
reading them over once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a good memory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good! Marvelous, I should say. If you save the
piece by playing that part pretty well to-night, you will
pull us out of a bad hole and show yourself cut out for
an actor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was all Havener had to say, and it was remarkable
for him, as he seldom complimented anyone. He was
profuse with his criticisms, and sparing with his compliments.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Frank left the building by the stage door, he remembered
that he had in his pocket a letter which he
wished to mail. The post office was near at hand, and in
that direction he turned his steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the window of a store near the post office were two
“boards,” on which were photographs of the various members
of the “Empire Theater Comedy Company,” and
some photographed scenes from the various plays in the
repertory of the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two very pretty girls, sixteen or seventeen years of age,
had paused to look at the pictures, and Douglas Dunton,
coming out of the post office, observed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton considered himself a great masher, and he
knew that, as a rule, young girls entertain a foolish admiration
for actors in general, so he did not hesitate to
walk up to this couple and speak to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls looked startled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be alarmed, young ladies,” said Dunton, in his
most amiable manner. “I saw you looking at the pictures.
I presume you are going to the play to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls looked at each other, and then turned their
backs squarely on the presuming fellow, their action saying
as plainly as words that they did not care to have
anything to do with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell, coming along, saw all this, and it gave
him a feeling of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Dunton was not to be turned down thus easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am one of the actors,” he purred, in a manner intended
to be very captivating. “That is my picture in the
upper right-hand corner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls looked at each other again, and they smiled
a bit at the conceit of the fellow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton misinterpreted the smile to mean that they were
softening toward him, and he continued, glibly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a disagreeable part to-night, and you will not
see me at my best if you come. I am the villain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the girls gave him a look, and then murmured to
the other:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too soft to be a villain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then both giggled, as young girls will.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton flushed a bit, but he was not to be rebuffed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” he laughed. “I can stand a little
jolly like that. Don’t you want free passes to the show
to-night? I happen to have two. Here they are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls hesitated. Surely this was a great temptation
to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had paused to watch the success of Dunton’s
efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take them, girls,” urged the presuming actor. “You
are welcome to them. I will see you after the show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was enough to decide one of the girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We do not accept presents from strangers, sir!” she
said, cuttingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other one looked disappointed, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then permit me to introduce myself,” laughed the
masher. “I am Douglas Dunton, of the Empire Theater
Comedy Company. Now you can take turns in introducing
each other to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a very pretty little scheme, and one of the
girls, who had light hair and blue eyes, would have fallen
into Dunton’s snare readily enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her dark-haired companion, however, had more stamina
and sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you kindly go away and leave us!” she exclaimed,
sharply. “You are very annoying, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Dunton was cut to the quick.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so!” he sneered. “You’re altogether too stuck
up, Miss Prim. I don’t care about talking to you, anyway;
but the other young lady has more sense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come away, Lottie,” said the dark-haired girl, pulling
her companion. “He is insulting, and there is no one near
to protect us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was Frank Merriwell’s cue. He stepped forward
instantly, lifting his hat to the girls and murmuring:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Permit me to offer my services.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he turned on his fellow actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Dunton,” he said, grimly, “you have not shown
yourself much of a gentleman in your attempt to force
your attentions on these young ladies. You had better
desist.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton gave a snarl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go to blazes!” he hissed. “If you fool around me,
you’ll get thumped!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He made a threatening movement, but Frank did not
stir, looking him straight in the eyes, and quietly saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t advise you to try it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was too much for the angry actor, and, despite the
time and place, he aimed a blow at Merry’s cheek with his
open hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank ducked like a flash, came up instantly, caught the
fellow by the collar, whirled him about and gave him a
push away, advising:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on, now! Don’t try that a second time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he turned to the girls, swiftly speaking:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very sorry you have been annoyed, and I think
you had better get away from here at once, so you will not
be connected in gossip with an actor’s row, in case Mr.
Dunton forces me to fight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The dark-eyed girl gave him a grateful and admiring
look, and they both hastened away.</p>

<p class='c008'>By that time Dunton had turned, his face now white
with rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You interfering puppy!” he grated. “I said I’d do it,
and now I will!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He came at Frank with a rush.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very tall, lank youth and a short, fat lad, who were
approaching, uttered simultaneous exclamations:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh all hemlock!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shimminy Gristmas!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a fight, Hans!” cried Ephraim Gallup.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” said Hans, breathlessly, “id peen a vight!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Frank Merriwell is in it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw, he peen in id, und der odder veller peliefs he vos,
too, but he vill seen his misdake britty soon alretty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou bet! Whoop! Looker that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For Frank had met Dunton’s rush squarely, parried
the fellow’s blow, and knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls, looking back, saw all this.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton was stunned, dazed, astounded. He sat up,
clasping a hand over his eye, and staring at Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans and Ephraim strolled up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Py Chorch!” said the Dutch lad. “I nefer oxbected to
seen Misder Tunton seddin’ himseluf down to rest der
sidevalks on like dot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal,” drawled Ephraim, his face twisted into a
comical grin, “yeou can’t never tell jest whut a feller with
a real light head will do. He’s apt to lose his b’lance an’
set daown ’most anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vot you peen doin’ him to, Vrankie?” inquired Hans,
innocently. “He don’d seem to felt as vell as you might,
don’d id?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He does look kainder gol darn sick to his stummick,”
nodded Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the townspeople began to gather around, and
Dunton hastily rose to his feet. He glared at Frank, muttered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right! all right! You’ll settle for that! I’ll remember
it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he started away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If yeou want a slice of beefsteak fer that air eye,”
drawled the youth from Vermont, “there’s a butcher shop
daown the street a piece.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton did not reply or turn about.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd was curious to know what the trouble was
about, and so Frank made haste to get away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans and Ephraim accompanied him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That air chap kainder run up ag’inst a snag, didn’t he,
Frank?” said the Yankee. “Whut was the raow abaout?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry explained, as they entered the post office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vale,” said Hans, sagely, “some beoble don’d knew so
much pefore some dings happens as they knew afterward
britty queek.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That chap hates yeou, Frank,” asserted Ephraim;
“and yeou want to look aout for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t seem to be very dangerous,” smiled
Merry, dropping his letter into the slot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou can’t tell abaout that. When he finds he can’t
hurt ye in a fair way, he’s purty gol darn sure to try some
other way. I wouldn’t trust him an inch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They left the post office and proceeded to the hotel,
where Frank went at once to his room, failing to appear
at supper time, as he was busy studying his part, and
could not spare time to eat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alone in his room, Merry walked the floor and dug
away at the lines. His door was closed, and he repeated
his part, seeking to discover the proper manner to emphasize
the different expressions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was thoroughly disgusted by the slovenly pronunciation
of the average traveling actor, but the matter
of emphasis, he had discovered, was given less attention
than that of pronunciation. Indeed, many actors mouthed
their lines so that the real meaning was utterly obscured,
or the words were made to seem to mean something quite
different from what the playwright intended.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for gestures and poses, Frank knew that, on an average,
twenty actors gesticulate too much for one who gesticulates
too little. The absence of gesticulation is rarely,
if ever, missed, while too many gestures are almost certain
to be offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some actors seem to fancy they must do something with
their hands every time they open their mouths, and they
quickly become annoying to the audience. It is often the
case that action is the resort of impotency.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had studied since starting out with the company,
and he had learned a great deal about actors and their art.
He had found there were books that would give him
much needed information, and he had not lost time in procuring
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Frank’s hobby to know something about everything
possible, and to know everything possible about the
business with which he was connected.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was this that had caused him to get ahead so rapidly
in railroading, and, now that he was no longer employed
on a railroad, he hoped to get ahead swiftly in his new
line of work.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of his books had told him that, “More than all
else, it is an actor’s utterance that fixes his position as an
artist,” and, meditating on the skill of the best actors he
had seen, Merry soon decided that this was true.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was plain enough to Frank that the “old-time” actor
who resorted to vocal gymnastics, roaring or cooing, as he
fancied the occasion required, did not possess so much
actual force as some quiet “new-school” actors, who seldom
raised their voices above a certain pitch, yet who
succeeded in putting deep intensity into their expressions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry had decided that the beginning and end of the
actor’s study should be the art of delivery. The other
things an actor must learn are comparatively easy, but the
art of “reading” well is so difficult that very few actors
become sufficiently acquainted with it to discover how difficult
it really is.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank knew he could not learn to deliver his part properly
in the short time given him to commit it, but he resolved
to do his best on the lines he did commit, and so
he studied them over carefully to discover just how they
should be spoken.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was plain enough to him that “the art of elocution” as
taught by ninety-nine elocutionists out of a hundred was
something that had far better be left unlearned if a person
really wished to become an actor, for those “elocutionists”
give their attention almost wholly to modulation,
and very little to the meaning of what they read.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the matter of emphasis, elocution teachers, as a rule,
instruct their pupils to emphasize words, but properly it is
ideas and not words that should be emphasized.</p>

<p class='c008'>Books on elocution give certain arbitrary rules to be
followed, but no rule that will apply to all cases can be
made, and brains are far better than rules.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merriwell shut himself up in his room to give his
brains a chance to study out certain things in connection
with his lines, as well as to commit the words to memory.
Almost anybody can commit words so they may be reeled
off parrot-like, but it takes intellect to speak words thus
committed so that they convey the meaning the author
intended they should convey.</p>

<p class='c008'>So intent was Frank on his work that he did not notice
when his door swung open, and he did not know two
persons had entered the room till one of them spoke to the
other. That one said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut the door and lock it, Sargent! We’ve got him
alone, and I’ll black both his eyes before anybody can come
up and stop the muss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank whirled about, dropping the manuscript play on
his bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton and Sargent were there, and Dunton was taking
off his coat in a very significant manner, while Sargent
was hastily locking the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was trouble in the air.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>DUNTON’S DISCOMFITURE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Frank did not wait to be attacked. He made a flying
leap at Dunton, caught the fellow with his coat halfway
off, and flung him clean across the bed, so that his head
was rammed against the wall with a thud that seemed to
shake the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he went at Sargent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sargent turned to meet him, but did not get round
quick enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank slammed him up against the door so that it nearly
burst open.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glad you gentlemen called,” he declared, gently.
“Make yourselves at home. I shall do my best to entertain
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had Sargent by the neck, and he thumped the fellow’s
head against the door so hard that the panel was
cracked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wow!” cried Dunton’s astonished friend. “I didn’t
come up to fight with you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you didn’t?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did you come?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To see fair play.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was that it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. Ouch! You hurt!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you don’t seem to be fighting much,” observed
Frank, disgustedly. “Get in under cover out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He caught Sargent by the slack of his trousers and the
collar and fired him under the bed just as Dunton crawled
off it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sargent went in till nothing but his heels stuck out, and
there he lay, making no effort to retreat, evidently being
well satisfied to get out of the way like that, for it had
dawned on him that he and Dunton were “up against it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton was raving mad. He literally frothed at the
mouth as he came off the bed and leaped on the ex-Yale
athlete.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll kill you!” he howled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you?” inquired Merry, calmly. “I don’t think!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton tried to get him by the throat. For some moments
there was a terrific struggle, during which a chair
and a stand were overturned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton was nerved by such fury that he made a desperate
antagonist for a time, but he could not hold out
against Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seeing he was about to get the worst of it, the fellow
tried to get some kind of weapon out of his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you!” cried Frank, catching his wrist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a minute!” returned the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re pretty bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll find out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p class='c008'>Somebody was pounding on the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s going on in there?” cried a voice. “What are
you doing, Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I am practicing a little,” answered Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The door is locked, and my hands are full.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hands full of what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Man. Got one under the bed, and the other is—going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a twist and a snap, Frank whirled Dunton about,
caught him up off his feet, sent him shooting under the
bed by the side of Sargent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he quickly unlocked the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Walk in, Mr. Havener,” he politely invited.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage-manager did so, looking around in wonder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s the man?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank pointed, and his finger indicated two pairs of
feet sticking out from under the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener stared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Came in to do me up,” Merry explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but—what are they doing under the bed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By gum!” chuckled the voice of Ephraim Gallup, who
was now standing in the open door. “I guess they’re
huntin’ fer him under the bed. Haw! haw! haw!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Havener, and he was a man
who seldom smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>One pair of feet began to kick, and the owner struggled
to get out from beneath the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come out, both of you,” commanded Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>They did so, one at a time, and two more crestfallen,
sheepish, disgusted-looking fellows never showed their
faces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t come here to fight,” Sargent hastened to again
declare.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton said nothing, for he could find no words to
express his feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup continued to roar with laughter, and
all the noise had brought several more of the company to
the spot, together with other guests of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton ground his teeth together when he realized what
a spectacle he was, and the one look he gave Frank Merriwell
was murderous. Then he made a break for the
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me out!” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go it!” cried Ephraim. “I don’t wonder yeou feel like
runnin’! By gum! if I was yeou, I’d feel like findin’ a
hole somewhere and crawlin’ inter it. Them fellers came
up here to lick Frank Merriwell in his room,” he explained,
as Sargent hastened after his chum. “Gosh all
hemlock! They couldn’t ’a’ done it if they’d bin ten of
’um, ’stead of two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The proprietor came up, and Merriwell apologized for
the disturbance. Havener, however, was forced to pacify
the man, which he finally succeeded in doing, with the
assistance of Hawkins, who had found the soft side of the
hotel keeper at an early date.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why haven’t you been down to supper, Merriwell?”
asked the stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No time,” answered Merry, shortly. “Studying. I
won’t eat till after the show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t get anything in this hotel at that hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’ll patronize a lunch cart. Can’t spend time to
eat. Those fellows cut me out of fifteen minutes. Send
somebody to tell me when it’s necessary for me to go to
the theater.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” promised Havener, as he hustled everybody
out of the room. “I don’t think you’ll be disturbed again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Closing the door, Frank picked up the manuscript and
went on studying as if nothing had happened. In a moment
he dismissed the encounter from his mind and gave
his entire attention to the lines he was learning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank continued to study till Hans came to tell him
that the band was going to play before the theater, and the
company was going over to make up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank found Havener waiting in the office of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How are you making it?” asked the stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fairly well,” answered Frank, modestly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you do as well as I hope, you will save us from
making a big fizzle to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall do my level best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went over to the theater, and Frank immediately
sought his dressing room to make up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Dan Lee was there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cassie told me I’d better help you make up, Merriwell,”
said the veteran actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Mr. Lee,” smiled Frank, “but I believe
I can do the trick without assistance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, if you say so; but I’ll stay and put on the
finishing touches.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t a make-up box. Shall have to borrow from
somebody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here,” said Lee, “use what you want out of this one.
It belonged to that fellow Storms, but he will do his making
up in jail for some time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank began work with the grease paint, and then
Dunton came in. He stopped and glared at Merry, astonished
to find him in that dressing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What the——” he began, and then stopped short.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later Dunton made a dive forward and
caught up the make-up box Frank was using.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, talk about crust!” he snarled; “this beats! Drop
that stick of grease paint!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank turned and surveyed him, quietly asking:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It doesn’t belong to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does it belong to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because it does.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was Storms’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He left it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a lie!” declared Dan Lee, who had been watching
everything. “Storms didn’t give it to anybody, but
you took it. Before that you bummed make-up off everybody
else, because you spent all your money for drinks,
and didn’t have so much as a piece of coco-butter of your
own.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dry up!” snapped Dunton. “You’re always poking
your nose into something that doesn’t concern you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This business concerns me, for I told Merriwell to use
that stuff, and by the gods! he’s going to use it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He shan’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He shall!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old actor slammed the dressing-room door and
placed his back against it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not going to take that box out of here,” he
declared. “Put it down till Merriwell is through with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then Merriwell will take it away from you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let him try it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead, Merriwell,” directed old Dan; “and thump
him if he don’t give it up instanter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank started toward Dunton, who backed away, holding
onto the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep off!” grated the fellow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it up!” commanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton backed against the partition, and Frank confronted
him. The fellow remembered how he had been
handled not very long before in Merriwell’s room, and he
scarcely wished to fall into Frank’s hands again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t have it!” he declared, weakening somewhat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it up!” repeated Merry, sternly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, like a flash, Dunton lifted the box and hurled it
at the head of the youth he hated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank dodged, and the box flew past his head, striking
the partition and falling to the floor, where its contents,
powder, paint, puffs, and so forth, flew in every direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dan Lee uttered an exclamation of anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now thump him, Merriwell—thump him hard!” cried
the old actor. “He deserves it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Frank, scornfully. “I should be ashamed
to do it. He is too contemptible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he turned and stooped to gather up whatever he
could of the contents of the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton fancied he saw his opportunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The warning came from old Dan just as Dunton leaped
onto Frank’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry was crushed to the floor, but Dan Lee rushed
forward and caught Dunton by the collar, dragging him
off his intended victim.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up to his feet shot Frank, and he caught hold of his
enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Open the door!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lee hastened to do so, and Merriwell lost no time in
throwing Dunton out of the dressing room, being unable
to resist the temptation to give him a boost with his toe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow was sent sprawling, his undignified exit being
witnessed by several members of the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank turned back and gathered up such of the contents
of the box as he could, and then resumed the work of
making up.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did it rapidly, closely watched by old Dan. In a very
short time Frank had finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There,” he said, turning to be inspected, “now I will
listen to your suggestions, Mr. Lee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ain’t got any to make,” said old Dan. “You’re all
right; but where’d you learn to make up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’ve watched the others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Watching wouldn’t teach you to put it on like that
without making a single mistake. You’ve had some practice.
Where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little at college.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“College?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What college?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you go to Yale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never knew it before. Why didn’t you say something
about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know, but you never say anything about
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think much of fellows who are forever telling
something about themselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No more do I,” nodded old Dan. “You’re all right.
But how did you learn to make up at college?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We had amateur theatricals.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course we had to make up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you were greenies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could you learn to do it like an expert?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got a book of instructions and studied it till I knew it
by heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huah! Don’t take much stock in such books. Fellow’s
got to learn by experience.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I got some experience.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the others found I knew something about it, and
I had to make up the whole company. In that way I got
a chance to try my hand at all sorts of characters, for some
of the fellows impersonated old men, some brigands, some
girls, and so forth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said old Dan, “I rather think you have a way
of catching onto things in a hurry. You’re all right.
What are you going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Study till it is time to go on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was to appear in the first act in ordinary street
clothes, so his costume for that act gave him no trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the manuscript and sat down in a corner, where
he went at it again, and he did not even hear the band
when it played its first piece in the theater. He was
aroused by Havener, who came in and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to take that manuscript now, Merriwell. The
curtain goes up in two minutes.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK’S FIRST APPEARANCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Frank stood behind the scenes, ready to make his first
entrance. Outwardly he was as calm as a clock, but inwardly
he was not so calm. Anyone looking at him closely
must have observed that his eyes shone with a strange
light. Whether his face was pale or not could not be told,
for the make up concealed that.</p>

<p class='c008'>The play had started off all right, and already the
audience was giving it close attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>The house was good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie had found an opportunity to whisper to Frank:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep a stiff upper lip, my boy. I’ll bet on you. You’re
a winner, and I know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Cassie,” he smiled, quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dunton’s the one that’s liable to go to pieces to-night,
for he’s in a deuce of a state. He’s been drinking, too.
I’ll bet he gets stiff after the show. That fellow hates you
so he’d like to kill you now. Look out for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long, and good luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw by her appearance that she had resorted to her
regular stimulant, and again he thought:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Cassie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Even in that moment when his own affairs weighed on
him so heavily he thought of another.</p>

<p class='c008'>What was that? One of the actors was speaking, and it
was the speech that preceded his entrance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moment had arrived at last!</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank nerved himself, and then he—entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a single instant it seemed that his tongue was numb
in his mouth and he would not be able to speak, and then,
with grace and dignity he advanced down the center, smiling
and delivering his first speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moment he gave utterance to the first words his
embarrassment left him and he was quite at ease. He
made a fine appearance and impressed the audience favorably.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank went through the scene splendidly, for it was the
one he had rehearsed most, barring the duel scene. He
had the air and bearing of a professional actor, and no
one in the audience could have imagined him a novice.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Dunton was not on the stage at the time, he had a
chance to stand in the first entrance at the left and watch
everything. His heart was swelling with rage, and he did
his best to attract Merriwell’s attention, hoping to break
Frank up by a sneering look.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Frank gave strict attention to the people on the
stage, and neither glanced toward the wings nor the audience.
In fact, when he left the stage he had not seen a
single person besides those with whom he had had business
before the footlights.</p>

<p class='c008'>His exit was effective, and there was a ripple of applause
as he delivered the final speech of the scene and
retired from the stage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton was chewing his tongue viciously, and swearing
beneath his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, the fellow shall have a tumble before the piece is
over!” the stage villain muttered. “I’ll see to it that his
light is dimmed. He shall not triumph to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener received Frank as he came off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did first rate that time, Merriwell,” he said, encouragingly.
“If you can keep that up, you will make
a hit, but you know the hardest is to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” came quietly from Frank’s lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you feel shaky?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s good! You will do it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank saw that the stage-manager was giving him all
the encouragement possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener himself was playing a part, but he had very
little business on the stage with Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie soon came round and congratulated Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell, my boy, you did it great!” declared the
little soubrette. “I was proud of you. You made a
splendid appearance. If I wasn’t stuck on Ross, I’d be
head over heels in love with you this minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t make me blush, Cassie!” protested Frank, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I ain’t giving you taffy; this is straight goods.
I saw Dunton watching you. His face was like a thundercloud,
and he glared as if he longed to kill you. Didn’t
you see him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was standing in the first entrance on the other
side. I know he tried to catch your eye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thought he could break you up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he didn’t succeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I was mighty glad. He’s a bad egg. Some
day he’ll hit you a slam in the back that will hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I rather think he’ll drop it after a while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He won’t drop it, for he ain’t that kind. He’s a
snake. But I must go on in a minute. See you later.
Keep the good work up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She skipped away.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Frank next went on, many of his lines were with
Dunton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it was that Dunton did his best to break Merry
up. He transposed his speeches, getting everything in,
but failing to give Frank more than a third of the cues,
and often the continuity of the conversation depended entirely
on the cues.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, Frank was placed at a disadvantage, but
he faked as well as he could and covered the breaks
as far as possible. Indeed, he astonished and disgusted
Dunton by his skill in carrying the scene along.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when Dunton left the stage Havener was waiting
for him, looking decidedly ugly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, man!” came harshly from the stage-manager;
“what do you mean by this kind of work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton pretended to be astonished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What kind of work?” he asked, with pretended innocence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know what kind of work!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not, sir. I am sure——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will do! You did your best to rattle Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing of the sort. I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t lie about it, Dunton! I have been in this business
too long not to see through such tricks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Havener, this is the third time to-day——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is the third time I have been forced to tell you
something you do not like to hear, and it will be the last
time. If I have to make any further talk to you this
day it will be to tell you that you are discharged.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was straight talk, and Dunton could not misunderstand
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You dare not discharge me without good cause. I
have a contract with Barnaby Haley, and you cannot
give me any release.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That for your contract!” he said. “It was with the
old ‘All-Star Combination,’ and does not hold with the
new company. You have no contract with Haley and
Hawkins, I know that, and, if I see fit to release you, out
you go. So now be careful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such threats are uncalled for, Mr. Havener.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am talking business to you, for there is no other way
to handle you. You are so sore on Merriwell that you
seem crazy to do him some sort of injury. If you keep
it up, you will injure yourself—nobody else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall appeal to Mr. Haley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will. The next time you have lines with
Merriwell, however, give him his proper cues. If you
don’t——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener stopped of his own accord, and the look he
gave Dunton was more significant than words. Then he
turned away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thoroughly sore and heartsick, Dunton watched the
climax of the first act, which was worked out splendidly
and received a burst of applause as the curtain descended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, behind the scenes, Dunton saw the members of
the company gather around Merriwell and congratulate
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gods!” grated Frank’s new enemy. “I can’t stand
that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rushed away to one of the dressing rooms, where
he raved like a mad person.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having worked himself up to this pitch in his hatred
for Merriwell, Dunton was ready for almost anything.
He felt that he must ease his mind by talking to somebody,
and he uttered an exclamation of satisfaction when Sargent
came in to make a change in his costume and make
up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think of it?” he hissed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of what?” asked Sargent, as he went about making
the necessary change.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of what!” snarled Dunton. “Why, curse it! of this
Merriwell business, of course!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think he did remarkably well,” said Sargent,
shifting his collar and tie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton caught his breath and looked dazed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did well?” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so,” murmured Sargent, looking in the
glass as he adjusted the knot in his tie. “I think it was
about the best job I ever saw, considering the circumstances.
I don’t understand how he did it so well on such
short notice. The fact that he committed the lines and
was able to speak them on the stage is something beyond
my understanding.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton made a rush, caught his chum by the collar,
swung him round and glared into his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you got it, too?” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? Got what?” asked Sargent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This foolishness over that fellow. Everybody else
seems to have it, and now, by the eternal skies! you’ve
caught it. It’s too much! Now I will kill him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better not,” said Sargent, calmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean? Are you going back on me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, what——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m simply going to let Merriwell alone in the future,
and I advise you as a friend to do the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To blazes with your advice—and you, too! You’re
a squealer! That’s what’s the matter with you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sargent simply shrugged his shoulders and went on
making the necessary changes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A squealer!” repeated Dunton, grinding the words
derisively through his teeth. “You are scared of Merriwell,
and so you are going to quit. I hate a quitter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you are getting very excited, Dug,” murmured
Sargent, applying some powder to his neck. “What you
need just now is a good, cold shower bath.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you need is a good thumping!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what you said Merriwell needed, and I went
up to his room with you to watch you give it to him,” reminded
Sargent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bah!” Dunton almost howled. “So you fling about
that! I didn’t think this of you! You’ve gone back on
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, dear fellow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, you have! You’re afraid of Merriwell! You
are a blamed coward!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In your excitement, Dug, you are saying a number
of unpleasant things. I have found out a few things
about Merriwell, and I know he is a bad man to fool
with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right; but take my advice and let him alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll let him alone when I’ve done him up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’ll get done up yourself, old man. Why, this
Merriwell was in Yale less than a year ago, and was called
the champion all-around athlete of the college. He was
a great oarsman, football player, sprinter and jumper.
As for scrapping, they say he whipped the bully of the
college without getting a mark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lies—all lies!” palpitated Dunton. “I don’t believe
the fellow ever saw Yale College.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The trouble with you is that you won’t believe anything
you don’t want to believe; but I guess this stuff
about Merriwell is straight goods.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lies, lies!” Frank’s enemy snarled. “How do people
know so much about him all at once?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s been telling such stories, and that is enough to
stamp them as lies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess not. I remember seeing his name in the papers.
Frank Merriwell was often spoken of in connection
with Yale sports and athletics.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t that enough to prove what I’ve been telling you
has some foundation, at least?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Frank Merriwell spoken of may have been quite
another fellow. I know it was not this chap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, didn’t we pick him up on the road, and hadn’t
he been working on a railroad! Such a famous Yale man
wouldn’t be shoveling coal on a railroad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know. I’ve heard he lost his fortune and was
forced to leave college and go to work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t take any stock in such a fairy story, and you
are a fool to believe it. He’s just a common upstart, and
I am going to take the starch out of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ve warned you. I am your friend, Dug; but
I’m not monkeying with Merriwell any more. You’ve had
bad luck at it. Havener is sore on you, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sore on him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s the stage-manager, and he stands in with Haley.
He can get you fired if he wants to do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They can’t get along without me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s where you make a mistake. They’d find a way
to get along without you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton looked thoroughly disgusted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see you have gone back on me, even though you
say not,” he said, dejectedly. “I didn’t think it of you,
Art!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned away, and Sargent quickly stepped to his
side, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am still your friend, Dug, but I can’t afford to get
into trouble and lose my engagement. You know I’ve
got a mother——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton flung off the hand his friend had placed on his
arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The same old mother cry!” he sneered. “You pretend
you send all your money to your mother, and that’s
why you’re forever broke. That mother of yours is in a
Tenderloin flat in New York, I’ll bet, and it’s ten to one
she’s drinking fizz with another popper to-night. I’ve
sized you up as a good, soft thing. You’ve had your
leg pulled till it’s a wonder you can walk without crutches.
Soft things always make me tired!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He left the dressing room, with Sargent standing in
the middle of the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right!” muttered the latter; “all right, Dunton!
I have been your friend, but I rather think this ends it.
My conscience won’t trouble me if I quit you after this.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Douglas Dunton was “sore.” He felt that, besides other
unpleasant things that had happened, he had lost his
friend and chum, and he blamed Frank Merriwell for it
all.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when he saw Merriwell carry his part through the
second act quite as well as he had done in the first, only
getting adrift twice, and then faking lines so that it was
unnecessary to prompt him, Dunton actually was sick.
His lips, on which there were no coloring, looked blue
and cold, and his flesh was clammy to the touch.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Merriwell won a burst of applause, Dunton
cursed the audience for a lot of fools, but took care that
his curses were not heard by anyone.</p>

<p class='c008'>To add to his rage, Cassie had the impudence to sweetly
ask him if he didn’t think Mr. Merriwell was doing
“real well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not make a reply—he could not.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll make a fool of the fellow in the duel scene,” he
thought. “I’ll show the audience just what a stick he is
before I am disarmed, and I’ll make everybody see that I
voluntarily permit him to disarm me. That’s where I’ll
get in my work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow, when he thought it over, this seemed a weak
sort of revenge. He longed to humble Merriwell, to
completely humiliate him, to disgrace him, if possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not hide from himself the fact that Merriwell’s
work thus far was really marvelous, and that added to his
rage immeasurably.</p>

<p class='c008'>How was it that this fellow, with no experience on
the stage, could take an important part, commit it in such
short time, and play it with the skill of a drilled actor?</p>

<p class='c008'>When the second act was over, Dunton was surly as
a dog with a sore ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener came and spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell is doing first rate,” said the stage-manager;
“but the duel will be difficult for him, and I want you to
help him as much as you can. You can help him make
it effective, if you will, and I shall be watching. Don’t
be foolish, Dunton. You can see now that it was better
not to put two persons onto new parts, instead of one, and
that’s what would have been done if I had let you play
the part Merriwell has. I just spoke to him about you,
and he says he holds no hard feelings. He will bury the
hatchet and forget all that has happened if you will do
the same. Now, come, promise me that you will help him
on the duel. Will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton hesitated, a sour look on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be a man,” urged Havener. “Promise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be a man!” Those words cut, and Dunton ground
his teeth softly. Then, all at once, he pretended to relent,
and he said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, I can’t forget so quickly, but I’ll do what
I can for the fellow on the duel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s good,” nodded Havener. “I shall be watching.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’ll do what I can for him!” grated Dunton,
softly, as the stage-manager moved away. “Oh, but you
had a crust to come to me and talk like that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the curtain went up for the third act, Dunton
was eager for the time of the duel to arrive. His eagerness
made him go at his part with more vim than heretofore,
and Havener, watching him, nodded his satisfaction,
saying to himself:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess the fellow sees at last that he has been making
a fool of himself. He’ll be all right, now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The third act went with a swing that fairly carried
the audience. Bursts of applause were frequent. The
play was a success, and Havener knew he would receive
congratulations from Haley, who was “on the front of
the house.” At last the duel scene was on. It was a
forest setting, and Merriwell, the challenged party, had
fallen into a snare set for him by Dunton, the villain,
by naming swords as the weapons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton and his second were first on the scene, and the
conversation between them was to the effect that in three
minutes the time set for the duel would pass, and there
were no signs of the challenged party.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton: “He will not come—he dare not come!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Second: “There is yet time. He may arrive at the last
moment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton: “He is a coward, from a race of cowards. He
poses as a gentleman, but the blood of a craven flows in
his veins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These words were spoken with an intensity and double
significance that Frank, waiting in the wings, did not
miss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Second: “The time is nearly up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton: “Yes.”—Looks at his watch.—“There is but
one minute more. He will fail to appear, and when next
we meet, I will brand him as the cur he is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Second: “You will come out of this affair honorably
without danger to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton: “Danger! Bah! What danger would there
be to face him! I would toy with him—play with him as
a cat plays with a mouse. I would let him see that he
was completely at my mercy. I would laugh at his clumsy
efforts, and then, when I had tired of the sport, I would
run him through the heart! But I shall not have that
pleasure.”—Closes watch with a snap.—“The time is up,
and he is not here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(Frank enters, followed by his second, with weapons in
case.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank: “You are wrong, sir; I am here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience, whose sympathy was entirely with Merry,
gave him a hearty round of applause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton: “Your craven feet must have faltered slowly
on the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank: “It was not the fault of our feet, sir; we lost
the way, and were forced to seek directions. I assure
you that we made all haste, and, now we are here, no
time shall be lost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then arrangements were swiftly made for the duel,
and soon the two young men stood face to face, stripped
of coats and vests, their swords in their hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duel began, and, at the very first, it seemed evident
that Dunton was the most skillful swordsman. But
Dunton himself soon discovered that Merriwell had lost
much of his apparent awkwardness displayed at the rehearsal,
and it called out the fellow’s best efforts to beat
Frank back and make a display of superiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton’s rage increased with every passing moment.
He was failing to make such a display of Merriwell as he
had hoped, and his anger drove him temporarily insane.
With terrible fury he beat Merry back and back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank retreated, watching his antagonist closely. All
at once, he saw a deadly glare in Dunton’s eyes, and the
fellow hissed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he lunged straight at Frank’s heart!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was no false movement, but it was a savage thrust
with murderous intent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank realized his danger on the instant. Dunton, insane
with anger, meant to kill him, and then declare it was
an accident.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merriwell leaped aside, and parried with a slight turn
of his wrist. The point of his enemy’s sword was turned
aside, but it passed through his shirt sleeve.</p>

<p class='c008'>Realizing he was baffled, Dunton fought like a fiend,
and the swords clashed and clanged, sparks flying from
the glittering blades.</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience little dreamed a real duel was taking
place on that stage, but never before had they witnessed
anything like it, and, as one man, they arose to their feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Clash! clash! clash! The ring of steel against steel
filled the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like young tigers, the two antagonists crouched and
darted and circled and sprang.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a most thrilling spectacle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Curse you!” panted Dunton, as he was baffled again
and again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a word came from Merriwell, but now there was a
light in his eyes that his enemy had never seen there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton could not reach Frank, try as he might, and he
began to realize that this fellow whom he despised was
really his master with the weapons they held.</p>

<p class='c008'>The seconds became alarmed and seemed about to interfere,
for they realized that there was something more
than acting about this wonderful duel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep back!” ordered Frank. “It will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do it yet!” vowed Dunton, inwardly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Merriwell was toying with the stage villain, a
true villain at heart, and, realizing what a poor showing
he was making, Dunton set his teeth and made a last
bold dash for the life of his foe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Right there Merriwell caught Dunton’s blade on his,
let it slip past till the hilts met, and then tore the weapon
from the fellow’s hand, sending it spinning into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton fell back, with a cry of amazement and horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down came the blade, and Merry caught it gracefully,
instantly offering it, hilt first, to his disarmed foe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton hesitated, then, like a flash, he snatched the
weapon and tried to run Frank through!</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Merriwell was not caught. Back he went with a
spring, and again his sword clanged against that of his
enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now it was not possible for the eye to follow all the
movements of those gleaming weapons. Frank was a
perfect whirlwind, and the terrible look on his set face
frightened Dunton beyond measure.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, being unable to withstand Merry, the fellow
dropped his sword and cried out for mercy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mercy!” shot from Frank’s lips. “What mercy do you
deserve? But go! I would not stain my hands with
such treacherous blood!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the curtain came down amid a perfect uproar of
applause.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>DUNTON SEES A LIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>“By Jove!” exclaimed Ross Havener, as he rushed onto
the stage the moment the curtain was down. “That was
great! Couldn’t have done it better if you had practiced
a year! Hear them roar! Why, they’re going to give
you a curtain call!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton started to move away, and he fairly staggered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on, Dunton,” commanded the stage-manager.
“You must go before the curtain with Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t!” gasped the wretched fellow. “I—I’m ill!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’ll be only a minute. You must go. Ready, Merriwell.
Out here. Go on, now. Bow—bow when they
applaud.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was pushed out, and he found himself before a
crowd that seemed beside itself with enthusiasm. Such
cheering he had never before heard in a theater. He
bowed and walked across.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Dunton came out. There was moderate applause,
and a few hisses, but it was plain that Merriwell was the
one who had won the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind the curtain Havener stopped them both.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand it now,” he declared. “Why, that
was more like a real duel than anything else! One time
I was actually scared, for I thought it was a trifle too
realistic. In fact, I don’t think it will do for you to go
at it like that every time, for you might make a slip that
would result in a dangerous wound. I noticed Dunton
made some pretty nasty thrusts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Dunton tried to get away, for he fancied Merriwell
would tell Havener everything.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It looked worse than it really was, I fancy,” smiled
Frank. “Mr. Dunton was very easy with me, and all his
thrusts were easily avoided.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton felt like wilting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter, Dunton?” asked Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you I am ill!” snapped the fellow. “Can’t you
see it? My nerves—are all—unstrung!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The duel was too much for you. Now, Merriwell
seems as cool as ice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton went down to his dressing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sargent was there, and he stared at Dunton as the
latter came in and dropped down limply on a square box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Sargent, “what do you think of Frank
Merriwell now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why!” gasped Dunton.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why! Don’t I know! Didn’t I watch it all! Didn’t
I understand! Think I’m a fool?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you driving at?” asked Dunton, weakly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know. You made a fool of yourself, Dug. You
tried to run him through!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow sprang up off the box, his eyes glaring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you dare say that!” he panted—“don’t you
dare! It’s a lie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the truth!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Curse you! You have turned against me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you are going to turn murderer—yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Murderer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would have been murder had you succeeded!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your purpose in that duel. You’d thought you could
make it seem an accident if you thrust Merriwell through.
You might have fooled a jury into believing it accidental,
but I should have known better. I should have known
you were a murderer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t—don’t use that word!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is the word that applies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The jig is up with me!” half whimpered Dunton.
“Merriwell knows, and he will denounce me. You know,
and you will say it is true. Oh, curse you both! I hate
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He seemed ready to burst into tears, and yet he was
quivering with rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dunton,” said Sargent, grimly, “you’re not in your
right mind. You have become insane through your hatred
for Frank Merriwell, and your insanity nearly led you
to commit a terrible crime. It was not your fault that
you did not succeed. If Merriwell had not been your
superior with a sword, you would have accomplished the
deed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton sat down on the box again, and dropped his face
on his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no use!” he muttered, thickly. “Everything has
gone against me! I am finished!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have no one but yourself to blame,” said Sargent,
rather stiffly. “I warned you to let the fellow alone. But
how is he going to prove that you really tried to run him
through?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t know I think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. If you will promise me to drop this thing here
and let Merriwell alone, wild horses can’t drag anything
out of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton lifted his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will remain my friend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’ll stick by you if you’ll quit this monkey business
and walk a straight line.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do it, if Merriwell don’t floor me for this first
round.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must take chances on that. Brace up, now,
and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; give me a drink. Here, I have something in
my coat. I must take a big drink, or I can’t play through
the last act. They won’t do anything with me till the
piece is over, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got out a bottle and took a heavy drink. To his
surprise, Sargent declined to take anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am done with the stuff for between-the-acts bracers,”
he said. “Those who want it may take it. Merriwell
doesn’t drink a drop, and he’ll have us all in the shade
before the season is over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you going to take him for a model?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may. It wouldn’t hurt either of us to pattern after
such a model.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dunton managed to get through the final act of the
play. Appearances indicated that Frank had not betrayed
him up to the end of the play, but he felt sure Merry
would do so immediately after all was over.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as possible, he wiped off his make-up, got into
his street clothes, and left the theater. He went straight
to the hotel, and proceeded to get as full of whisky as he
could hold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be good and drunk when they jump on me,” he
thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>How he got to bed or when he went he never knew,
but he awoke the following morning with a splitting headache,
and he was forced to start the day with two stiff
drinks. Those seemed to brace him up, and, dressing, he
went down to see what was being said about him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He met some of the members of the company, and they
congratulated him on the duel scene. At first he fancied
they might be trying to draw him out, but he soon decided
they were in earnest. That made it evident that
they knew nothing of the facts. But Havener must know.</p>

<p class='c008'>He met Havener, and two minutes’ conversation with
the stage-manager convinced him that Havener did not
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it began to dawn upon him that it was possible
Merriwell had not yet denounced him. Before long he
was convinced that this was true.</p>

<p class='c008'>What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s waiting for a good opportunity to take me
before the entire company,” thought Dunton. “Well, I’ll
give him the chance, and I’ll swear every word he says is
a lie. I never tried to run him through.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But, that afternoon at rehearsal, Frank had an opportunity
to make the denunciation, and did nothing of the
sort.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rest of the week passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Saturday night, after the show, Dunton found Merriwell
alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Merriwell,” he said, “when are you going
to do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do what?” asked Frank, surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blow the whole business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About that duel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you know I was furious with you, and I tried
to do you up for keeps. Of course, you will blow it to
Havener and the others. Why don’t you get about it?
I’m tired of waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Mr. Dunton,” said Merriwell, facing the
fellow squarely. “I want to ask you one or two questions.
First, aren’t you a little bit disgusted with yourself
for trying such a trick?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps so,” admitted Dunton, sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next, would you try it again if you had the chance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. I was a fool, and I’m glad I failed. I don’t want
to kill anybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought not, and I thought I would give you time
to come to your senses. You need not be afraid that I
will blow. I don’t want to hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You—you will keep still about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you act decent in the future—yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow was silent. He stood staring at Frank,
seeming uncertain what he had better do. Gradually the
blood flowed into his face till it was crimson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merriwell,” he said, huskily, “I never knew what a
blamed cheap cuss I am! You are a white man! You
would have served me right if you had blown the whole
thing. I can’t see why you didn’t. I don’t expect friendship
from you—I wouldn’t accept it; but I don’t think you
and I will have any more trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he turned and walked quickly away.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>BARNABY HALEY RECEIVES A TELEGRAM.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>“Barnaby Haley——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here! That’s my name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Telegram, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s have it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thirty cents, collect.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s it from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know. Sign for it here on the book.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley hesitated about going down into his
pocket and bringing up thirty cents for a message that
might be in the interest of the sender far more than himself.
The “Empire Theater Comedy Company” had been
“up against” bad business for a week, and Haley, who
was associate manager with Zenas Hawkins, the “angel,”
was not flush with money.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up to date, the “angel” had seen very little of success,
and he was beginning to weary of paying bills on every
hand and scarcely getting a chance to count the box office
receipts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it came about that Hawkins was nearing the end
of his string, and Haley knew it. Realizing that the
time might soon come when the “angel” would refuse to
be milked any longer and take himself out of the company
entirely, Mr. Haley was holding onto every cent
with the grip of grim death.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the messenger boy who had brought the telegram
to the office of the hotel at which the theatrical company
was stopping held onto the yellow envelope in a manner
that indicated that he was not to be fooled into letting
go of it till he had “the price.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a sigh, Haley parted with a silver quarter and a
nickel and obtained the message, for which he signed on
the messenger’s book.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any reply, sir?” asked the boy, waiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley tore it open. A moment later, as he read the
message, he started violently and turned pale. Then he
said something that would not look well in print.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several members of the company were sitting around
in the office, smoking, chatting and telling stories. Now
they were watching the corpulent manager, for all realized
that disaster might overtake the company any day, and
they dreaded the awful prospect of being stranded so far
from New York and the Rialto.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Merriwell had just finished writing a letter at the
writing table. As he was sealing it, he heard the exclamation
that fell from Haley’s lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ephraim Gallup, sitting near, guardedly drawled:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It kainder strikes me, b’gosh! the old man’s heerd
something he don’t jest like. I’ll bet a dollar the old
show goes bu’st inside a week. Yeou don’t darst take me
up, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s certain there’s trouble in the air,” said Frank,
in a low tone. “We’ve been doing a losing business for
more than a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we bu’st up, I s’pose yeou’ll blame me fer gettin’
yeou inter such a darn scrape?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; you didn’t know what was coming. Besides that,
I have had some experiences of value to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeou’ve learnt something abaout the business, anyhaow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and I have had some experience as an actor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yeou’ve jest shown ’em that yeou was no slouch.
Half the old han’s are jealous of ye, but they don’t say
so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, not quite as bad as that, Ephraim.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sur, jest that. I don’t take back a bit of it.
They don’t like to see an amatoor do better’n they kin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Lawrence is with us now, and I shall not get
much show in the future. You know they had to run
me into his parts when he was ill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I bet yeou git a chance, jest the same. Roscoe Havener
ain’t goin’ to keep a stiff on a part when he’s got a
good man right handy that he kin run in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if what you are afraid of happens, it’s little
good my opportunities will do me. I feel a strange curiosity
to know the contents of that message.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Barnaby Haley had crumpled the yellow sheet in one
thick hand, and the look on his phlegmatic face showed
he was unusually aroused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Answer, sir?” asked the messenger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No!” snarled the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy dodged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Needn’t bite my head off!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he skipped away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener, the stage-manager, came down from his room
and entered the office. Haley saw him, and fanned him to
approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage-manager saw at a glance that something was
the matter. Barnaby Haley’s dignity was broken. He
was angry, disgusted, desperate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” asked Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s blazes!” growled Haley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trouble?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Heaps of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley thrust the crumpled telegram into Havener’s
hand. The stage-manager smoothed it out and read the
message. Then he whistled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s queer,” he observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a thundering scrape!” grated the corpulent manager.
“Collins ought to be shot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you hear that name, Frank?” asked Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” nodded Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Know what they’re talkin’ abaout?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. Collins is the advance man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure pop. There’s somethin’ the matter with him, an’
that’ll bu’st the show sure. No show kin run ’thout a
corkin’ good man ahead of it, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t Collins a good man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s all right, but somethin’s happened. All the bad
luck is hittin’ us in a heap. There’s a hoodoo with this
show, and I know it, b’gosh! If Haley can’t yank any
more dollars aout of Hawkins, then there’ll be a reduction
of expenses. Know jest whut that means?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do. It means that the band will be dropped, fer
it’s an almighty big expense. Me and Hans will be aout
of a job. Mebbe the comp’ny kin hold together anuther
week by droppin’ the band, but we pull the craowd, and
we’ll be missed. Gol darned if this air show business is
jest whut it’s cracked up to be! It’s too blamed oncertain.
I wish I was to hum on the farm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It sounded like old times to hear Ephraim express such
a wish, and Frank smiled a bit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other actors in the office were showing anxiety.
They had huddled in a little group, and were talking in
low tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Zenas Hawkins entered. He was tall, thin and ministerial
in appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just the man we want to see,” said Haley. “Come
over here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he drew Hawkins and Havener into a corner,
where the telegram was shown to the thin “manager,”
who read it through, puckered up his face and scowled.</p>

<p class='c008'>A confidential talk between the three men followed.
Havener seemed struck by a sudden idea. He turned
and looked over the room, his eyes resting on Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come here, Merriwell,” he called.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank rose and approached the group, wondering what
they wanted of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley pursed his thick lips and stared coldly at Merriwell
as Frank came up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too young,” he grunted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think not,” said Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No experience,” objected the corpulent manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s smart,” declared Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Needs an experienced man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where can you get one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a case of necessity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Frank stopped and asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What can I do for you, Mr. Havener?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the stage-manager answered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Haley and Mr. Hawkins want you to go out in
advance of the show in the place of Collins, who has
thrown up his job and joined a rival company.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>THE INQUISITIVE STRANGER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Frank was surprised, but he immediately said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These ready answers seemed to please Roscoe Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are the only man available,” he said; “and we
can let you go now, for Lawrence is back with us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Right there Barnaby Haley hastened to put in:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are the only man available, and so we are forced
to take you. You have done remarkably well, Merriwell,
since I engaged you; but, of course, it takes an experienced
man to do the best work ahead of a company. You
haven’t the experience, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He lacked experience as an actor, Mr. Haley,” said
the stage-manager; “but he did a remarkable turn, just
the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was different—that was different. He could be
shown in that case; in this he must use his own judgment,
after receiving a few general instructions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know that no man can be shown how to act in
such a short time, Mr. Haley,” came quietly from Havener’s
lips. “He has tact, talent, ability. He has remarkable
catch-on-it-ive-ness. I say this before him, for I
do not believe he is in any danger of getting a swelled
head. I think you can give him his instructions and he
will take up Collins’ work just where Collins dropped it,
and carry it on successfully. I hate to lose him, for he
is a first-class utility man; but this seems to be a case of
have to, and I am ready to do what I can for the interest
of the company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could Collins break his contract?” asked Frank.
“How could he leave without proper notice?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He had no contract with the new concern,” explained
Haley. “All there was between us was his old contract
with me, as he was out ahead at the time we reorganized,
and I didn’t take the trouble to make a new contract for
him. Wish I had now, though he might have broken
it anyway. Couldn’t get anything out of him, for he hasn’t
anything; but I could make it hot for King for hiring
him away from me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is King?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“King!” blurted Haley, wrathfully. “He’s a scoundrel—a
confounded scoundrel! He’s the manager of the
‘Julian King Stock Company,’ a fake concern—a lot of
bum ham-fatters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A rival company?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rival company—rival to the ‘Empire Theater Comedy
Company’? Well, I should say not! Such a collection
of stiffs cannot be dignified by the title.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was plain to Merry that Haley entertained a strong
feeling of hatred for Julian King and his organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see, King treated Mr. Haley very shabbily,” explained
Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shabbily is not the word—not the word,” spluttered
the manager. “He robbed me! We were in Wisconsin.
Had been having a hard run. He was my partner in the
venture. We were playing ‘Uncle Tom.’ It became
necessary to raise money somehow to recover our trunks,
which the venial keeper of a third-rate hotel refused to
give up till his beastly bill was liquidated. We were
compelled to sell the donkey and some other property.
King secured the money thus obtained, and skipped with
it, leaving us worse off than before. I have never met
him face to face since that day, although we have been
in close proximity several times. Now he has induced my
advance man to quit me and go with his miserable old
show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see just what he wants of Collins,” said Havener,
“for he has had Delvin Riddle in advance, and Riddle
is one of the best men in the business. Riddle may
have left him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Left him—of course!” nodded Haley. “That’s what’s
happened. King couldn’t keep a man like Riddle. Now,
if we could get hold of him——But I suppose that’s out
of the question. We don’t know where he is. We’ll
have to send Merriwell out. It’s the best we can do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was plain he was not quite satisfied with the idea
of putting Merry ahead of the show, but accepted it as
the only resort.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hawkins was silent. He was a man who said very
little on any occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is barely possible that King hasn’t engaged Collins
for advance agent,” said Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What else could he want him for?” asked Haley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know Collins can fill a part, if necessary. He is
pretty good on old men. King may have taken him to
fill in a vacancy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He took him to injure me! That’s exactly what he
did! He is an ungrateful reprobate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he’s got him, anyhow; and the best thing we can
do is go right along as if we didn’t miss him at all.
Where was Collins when King scooped him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In Salacia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the next town?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dundee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Merriwell must take the morning train for Dundee.
You must provide him with complimentary passes,
press notices, the route booked, and instructions how to
proceed. I believe he will prove himself equal to the
emergency, and we shall get along all right as far as
the advance work is concerned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener spoke as if he were the actual manager of the
company, instead of being nothing but the stage-manager,
and Haley did not resent being told what he must do.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley made a pretense of asking Hawkins’ advice, but
Hawkins had not much to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the four went up to Haley’s room, where Merriwell
was given the necessary instructions in regard to
the route, making arrangements with local theater and
hall managers, securing accommodations at hotels, and
getting notices into the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here are the regular notices we have been using,” said
Haley, as he brought a lot of typewritten slips and sheets
out of his trunk and gave them to Merriwell. “You
must jolly up the editors of the papers, and get all the
space they will give us. A good advance man has a way
of faking up items and stories that editors will accept
as news, but which are advertisements of the best sort.
Of course, you won’t be able to do that, as you haven’t
had the experience, but you must work in as much of
this stuff as possible. And you must see that our paper
is up on every board available and in every good window
that can be obtained. If you do your work well, it will
be a case of hustle from the time you strike a town till
you leave it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And it’s my opinion that Merriwell is a hustler,” said
Havener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he has received his instructions. You must be
up in time to catch the early train out of here, Merriwell.
It leaves at 5:45 A. M. That’s all. I shall not get
a chance to talk with you any more, for I must see that
everything is settled up here for the move in the morning.
We take the seven o’clock train, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Haley was hustling Merriwell out of the room, when
Frank calmly observed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s one thing you have forgotten, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Transportation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum! So I did. Ah—Mr. Hawkins, will you kindly
attend to that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Hawkins looked sour and doubtful. Mr. Haley
was bland and persuasive. In three minutes he had
Hawkins feeling for his pocketbook; in five minutes he
had secured the needed cash. The “angel’s” leg had been
gently pulled once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Frank again appeared in the office, a young man
sitting near a window dropped his paper and got up
quickly, a look of pleasure on his face. He rushed forward
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear boy!” he cried; “how delighted I am to see
you again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He grasped Frank’s hand and shook it heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t see that you’ve changed a bit since you left
college,” declared the stranger, familiarly. “You’re the
same old Merriwell that was so popular and cut such a
dash. At first I could not believe it when I heard you
were here with a traveling theatrical company. Quite a
change from college life, eh, dear boy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is a change,” admitted Frank, looking sharply
at the familiar stranger and wondering where and when
they had met before, for, although he had a remarkable
memory for faces, there was nothing familiar about this
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so!” the other rattled on. “This knocking
around the country must seem strange. How are
all the fellows at Yale? I suppose you hear from them
regularly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” confessed Frank, “I can’t say that I do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t? Well, well, well! Don’t hear from the fellows
you used to chum with? That’s remarkable! But,
then, I suppose it is the way of the world. Come have a
drink with me, old man. We’ll be jolly and sociable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not drink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? Don’t drink? How long since?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never drank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger seemed doubtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I understand,” he nodded. “You were moderate
in your drinking. You never swam in it, like some of
the fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank flushed. There was something offensive about
the stranger’s manner, and yet the fellow seemed to mean
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you I never drank under any circumstances,”
came rather sharply from Merry’s lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I beg your pardon! You see, I didn’t know about
that. No offense, I trust?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand. I made a break. Just like me. But
I know you’re the kind of a fellow to forget it. Have a
cigar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A well-filled case was held toward Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not smoke.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sworn off?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never smoked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The dickens!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the stranger was astonished. He slowly extracted
a cigar from the case and lighted it, all the while staring
at Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you went to Yale College!” he exclaimed. “Didn’t
drink—didn’t smoke! And you were popular!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can’t be that you knew very much about me, or you
would have been aware that I neither drank nor smoked.
You have the advantage of me in——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger broke into a jolly laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I have. You had so many friends. I
didn’t expect you to remember me. Never mind. Come
down to the cardroom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t play cards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What—again! Never did?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! A relief! Then you have had one vice! Ha!
ha! Don’t mind my jollying, old fellow. You’re a rare
bird. Come down to the cardroom anyway. I want
to talk to you where there won’t be so many rubbernecks
around.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took Frank’s arm, and, somewhat puzzled and suspicious,
Merry permitted the fellow to lead him downstairs
to the cardroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were seated on opposite sides of a table,
the stranger again urged Frank to have a drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take a seltzer lemonade, a ginger ale, anything to be
sociable,” he urged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, without waiting for Frank to consent, he pushed
a button and called the barkeeper from the adjoining room.
Merry was urged to drink something, and finally ordered
ginger ale.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger took rum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Best drink a man can take this time of year,” he declared.
“Gives one a vile breath, but it keeps the system
in good condition, and it will not knock a fellow out like
whisky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is your opinion,” said Merriwell. “It is my
opinion that either one will knock a fellow out quick
enough if he sticks to it. It may do as a stimulant for a
very aged person, or it may be absolutely necessary in
some cases of sickness, but what any young man in good
health can want of such stuff I can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s because you never tried it. You’re not qualified
to judge, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have watched its effects on others, and never yet
have I seen that it did a well person any good. On the
other hand, I know of hundreds of instances where it has
done them incalculable injury.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, let’s not have a temperance lecture, Merriwell.
I didn’t bring you down here for that. Here’s our
drinks, and here’s success to you on the road in advance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank sipped his ginger ale, still keenly scanning his
companion. Who was this fellow? and what was he
driving at? It was plain he knew Merry was going out
ahead of the show.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger tossed his rum off at a gulp, following
it with a “chaser” of water, and smacking his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty good stuff, that,” he nodded. “Better’n one
can get in most places out in this infernal country. I
suppose you start out in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which way you going? I suppose the manager has
given you his bookings? Of course, you know all about
his route and his plans?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Merry nodded, but that was all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may be traveling your way,” said the stranger. “We
can go along together. That will be jolly. Which way
did you say you were going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t say,” answered Merriwell, dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The voluble stranger seemed brought to a stand for a
moment, but he quickly recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you didn’t say,” he laughed. “I suppose you are
going west? There are some good towns in the western
part of the State. Salacia, Dundee, Fardale, Crescent—all
along the line are good show towns. Of course, Haley
is going that way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, look here, my friend,” said Frank, pointedly,
“perhaps you will tell me why you are so anxious to
know which way the show is going? It seems rather
surprising to me that you should take such an interest in
us and be so anxious to learn our route.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow was not ruffled in the least.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” he murmured, with uplifted eyebrows, “it’s
simply because I happen to know you, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know you. I don’t remember ever seeing you
before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s not strange. Of course you forget many of
the men you met at college.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have been asking questions; now let me ask you
a few?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear fellow——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“First, what’s your name?”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this moment Leslie Lawrence, the actor whose place
Frank had filled, came strolling into the cardroom. He
paused, stared at Merry’s companion, and uttered an
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hang me if it isn’t Delvin Riddle!” he exclaimed.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>A STRANGE SOUBRETTE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Delvin Riddle!</p>

<p class='c008'>The name gave Frank Merriwell a shock, for Riddle
was the advance agent of the “Julian King Stock Company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In a flash, Merry understood the fellow’s little game.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had signally failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>King had not been able to pump the new advance man
of the “Empire Theater Comedy Company,” although he
had tried hard enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a bit of information had he drawn from Merriwell’s
lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Riddle!” cried Lawrence, stepping forward
swiftly. “What are you doing with Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a thing,” confessed Riddle, as he lay back lazily
and puffed at his cigar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you—you are working him! I know it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tried to,” coolly admitted Riddle. “No go. He’s a
clam. Won’t talk at all. Couldn’t get him to answer
questions, but he turned round and started in asking me
questions. Seemed suspicious. Wouldn’t drink, wouldn’t
smoke, wouldn’t do anything. What sort of a bird has
Haley found, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a mild disgust in the baffled fellow’s manner
and voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>A look of satisfaction came to Lawrence’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you didn’t get anything out of him?” he said, beginning
to smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a blamed thing,” acknowledged Riddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I compliment you, Merriwell!” exclaimed Lawrence,
heartily. “You have started in well on your new duties.
You’ll have to do considerable talking sometimes; but there
will be other times when you’ll need to keep your mouth
closed. If you talk as well as you have started in to keep
still, you are a winner. The laugh is on you, Riddle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right. What’ll you have?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little brandy will do me. I’ve been off my feet, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Drinks were ordered and brought, Frank refusing to
take anything. Lawrence proposed a toast, and they
drank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you get hold of Merriwell?” he asked of
Riddle. “Why, how do you happen to be here, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Business,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it’s strange I didn’t hear you were here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Came a short time ago. Dropped into the office and
heard a Yankee and a Dutchman talking about Frank
Merriwell being Haley’s new advance man. They didn’t
know me, so I pumped them. Got a description of Merriwell
and found out lots of particulars about him. When
he came into the office, I thought it must be him, and I
made a crack at him. Hit him, all right. Pretended I
had known him at college. That went, but I might have
saved my breath. Didn’t get a thing out of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle showed his disgust, but he was good-natured
about it. Then he complimented Merry on keeping still.
Frank laughingly assured him it had required no effort at
all, which caused Lawrence to “jolly” Riddle unmercifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank got away in a few minutes, leaving Lawrence
and Riddle together. He went to his room, taking a railroad
map with him, and there studied over the route he
was to follow, making himself familiar with the names
of the towns, distances to be “jumped,” time of trains,
population of the different places, and many other things
he considered worth knowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus Merry was starting out, as he started on everything
he undertook, by learning everything possible that
might assist him in any way.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked over the different notices, given him by
Manager Haley, so that he might become familiar with
them and know just what kind of stuff he was working
onto the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those notices were a disappointment to Merry. They
seemed too conventional, too tame, too much like other
notices of traveling shows, too plainly reading advertisements.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are poor stuff,” he muttered. “Nearly half of
them show in the first or second sentence that they are
advertisements. They are dry as chips. There is no life
or snap in them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he sat down and wrote three new notices. Over
these he spent some time, and of one of them he was particularly
proud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will be great for ‘Hayseed Valley’!” he exclaimed.
“That’s the piece the company opens with in almost
every place where they stay more than one night,
and they play it pretty often on one-night stands. I believe
that will be worth more than all the other notices.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In “Hayseed Valley,” a farce comedy of the rural order,
one of the characters was a French adventurer who pretended
to be a count, and who was persistently seeking
a rich wife. This is the notice Frank had written:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The inhabitants of this city (town) and surrounding
places are warned to be on the watch for a certain Frenchman
who has been creating considerable excitement in
this vicinity by his persistent and obnoxious attention to
ladies of wealth, both married and unmarried. This fellow
is an unscrupulous adventurer, who is masquerading
under the name of ‘Count Cavaignac,’ but it is safe to
say that he is actually no a-count, and he is certain to have
a number of furious husbands and brothers after him, if
he does not cease his annoying demonstrations and attentions
toward the fair sex. The base slander that every
American girl is eager for a title and ready to marry on
sight any foreigner who happens along and pretends to
rightfully own a title has been refuted by the treatment
‘Count Cavaignac’ has received from every sensible young
lady of this vicinity whose heart, hand and fortune he has
vainly sought to make his own. All of the bold count’s
adventures are highly ludicrous and doubly worth the
price of admission to ‘Hayseed Valley,’ in which the fake
nobleman appears. ‘Hayseed Valley’ is a rattling three-act
farce comedy, and it will be played at the —— Opera
House on (date here) by the ‘Empire Theater Comedy
Company,’ Haley &amp; Havener, managers and proprietors.
Don’t fail to see ‘Count Cavaignac.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other notices were of the unusual order, and Frank
believed they would prove of value. He slipped them into
his pocket, deciding to show them to Barnaby Haley and
seek his approval of their use.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Merry went over to the theater, where the afternoon
rehearsal was to take place. He found the company
assembled and the rehearsal about to begin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roscoe Havener came forward at sight of Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Merriwell,” he said, “Lawrence has been telling
us how you played the clam with Riddle, and I congratulate
you on starting out well. Just what Riddle was up to
I don’t understand, but he had some object in seeking to
learn our route. Haley is ready to shoot him on sight,
and he has gone in search of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cassie, the soubrette, approached. She looked pale and
thin and wretched.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry you’re not going to be with the company any
more, Frank,” she said; “but I hope you’ll have luck in
advance. You’ve been a good friend to me—and to Ross.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes,” said Havener, quickly; “he has done a good
turn for us both.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he moved away to give some directions about
setting the stage, leaving Frank and Cassie together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl looked at Merriwell, a mournful expression
in her face and eyes. Frank thought how great the change
when she came on the stage at night, bounding, buoyant,
vigorous, her eyes seeming to sparkle with life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry knew the cause of that great change, and he
wondered that Ross Havener did not see and understand.
It seemed impossible that Havener should attribute the
change entirely to excitement, for he must know that the
sameness of stagework made it seem to the girl like
any other occupation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall miss you, Frank,” said Cassie, in her melancholy
manner. “You’re not like the rest of the crowd.
You’re not common. Somehow, there seems to be something
dreadfully common about actors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is not the general opinion of them,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I know people generally think they’re freaks, but
that’s because they don’t know the real truth about them.
Actors are always posing so as to make folks believe they
are out of the ordinary. You can see that in their photographs
and everything. But you don’t have to pose,
Frank, to show that you’re no common duffer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cassie! Cassie! spare my blushes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m giving you straight goods. There’s a kind of air
about you that shows you ain’t no common stuff. I can’t
tell just what it is, but it’s there, all right. And I want
to tell you something that I’ll bet my hat on; I’ll bet you’ll
make a top-notch actor, if you stick to the profession. You
won’t be satisfied to be just an ordinary twenty-five a
week sidelight, but you’ll just climb up and up till you are
a star.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gracious, Cassie! but you are putting it on thick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been thinking of this since I saw how you filled
Lawrence’s place. On the dead quiet, I think you can
do just as good a job now as he can, and he’s given leads
almost all the time. When you have to play gentleman
parts, you’ve got the natural air, and Lawrence lacks that,
for he never had the breeding. I wish they’d kept you
pegging away, instead of shoving you on ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t mind it, Cassie, for I want to learn every
branch of the business. I may not stick to the profession,
but it is fascinating to me, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You like it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t mind the knocking around?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather enjoy that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor beds and poor grub?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can stand it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s different, but I don’t get discouraged very
easily, especially when the work is so interesting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stage fever. When they can stand all the hard knocks
and still find the work interesting and fascinating, they’ve
got it. You’re liable to stick to the stage the rest of your
life. Well, if you do, I hope I’ll live to see you away up
in the pictures, but I’m afraid I won’t be that lucky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Cassie, I don’t like to hear you talk like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s true, Frank. You know my trouble, and I
guess it’ll throw me down for keeps. I can’t shake the
habit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thought you were going to make a try at it this coming
summer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Am. Don’t believe it’s any use. If I fail, I’m going
to tell Havener the whole business, and we’ll cry quits.
That’ll be rough on me, for you know how much I think
of Ross; but I’ll never tie to him as I am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you’ll come out all right, Cassie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mebbe so. I know you want to encourage me, Frank;
but I’ve got the Old Scratch to fight. If I was religious,
there might be a chance for me; I could pray then, and
somehow it does seem that the prayers of real good folks
are answered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a remarkable thing for the girl to say, and
Frank wondered at it not a little. It was unlike Cassie,
but he said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It won’t do any harm to pray, even if you are not religious,
Cassie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what’s the use! God wouldn’t hear prayers from
such as me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do not know that,” came soberly and impressively
from Frank Merriwell’s lips. “You know it is said He
notes even the sparrow’s fall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it would seem foolish for an actress to get down
on her knees and pray.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not an actress, as well as anybody else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but you know how religious people regard us.
They don’t reckon we have any show of heaven.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Narrow-minded persons may think so, but there is no
reason why an actor or actress should not be a good
Christian and stand as good chance of reaching heaven
as a doctor, a merchant, or a person in any other profession
or business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a strange look on the girl’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you believe that?” she whispered; “do you really
and truly believe it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I might be sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The strange look on the sad face of the girl deepened,
and an infinite longing came into her weary eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow, Frank Merriwell felt that his words at that
moment might have great influence on her future, and he
was almost frightened by his position.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cassie,” he said, softly, his voice full of music and
persuasion, “I believe you can be sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was eagerness in her manner now, in contrast
to her usual listlessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be afraid to pray, if you feel like it. I am
not a professor of religion, yet I have prayed more than
once, and more than once, I firmly believe, my prayers
have been answered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Frank! you are so young and strong and
healthy! Why should you pray?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The young and strong and healthy should pray as
much as the weak and ill and diseased. Prayer was not
made exclusively for invalids, by any means.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you prayed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She could not seem to get over that. It was a wonder
to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said you were not like other people; I knew it all
the time. To look at you, one would think you the last
person in the world to pray.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t always judge by appearances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so. If I was going to pray, how would I go
about it, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She asked the question hesitatingly, timidly, with an
effort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just get down on your knees in your room, Cassie,
and pray. That is the way. There is no rule to follow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps—perhaps I’ll try it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do it, Cassie,” urged Frank, earnestly. “It won’t do
any harm, if it doesn’t do any good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It won’t be blasphemy for me to do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not if you are sincere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’m going to try it, Frank—I’m going to try it!
I’m not strong enough to break the dreadful habit alone,
and I believe the only way is for me to have some aid from
Heaven. You have given me new hope. If I should—if
I could get help that way, I’d owe everything to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he said, with deep impressiveness, “you would
owe it to no earthly power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking into her weary face, he softly added:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will pray for you, too, Cassie.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>STARTING OUT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>The following morning Frank was up bright and early
and ready to take the train.</p>

<p class='c008'>Havener came to the station to see him off, together with
Ephraim Gallup and Hans Dunnerwurst.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gol dinged if I ain’t sorry yeou’re goin’ to leave us!”
said the Yankee youth, dolefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaw,” nodded the Dutch boy, sniffing; “you vos sorry
I vos goin’ to left you, Vrankie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haow long do yeou expect to be aout ahead of the
show?” asked Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t tell about that,” answered Frank. “Perhaps
not very long, for I may not suit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll risk that,” said Havener. “You’ll be all right.
There’s something rather odd I’ve been thinking about—something
of a mystery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should Delvin Riddle try to pump you and get
our route from you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I suppose he wanted to know what towns we
were going to play in so he could——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Collins knew the route.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank started.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so!” he exclaimed. “Never thought of that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“King gobbled up Collins, and so, of course, Collins
told him the route.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it was so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it, exactly—why did Riddle take so much
trouble to try to pump it out of you? I’ve been puzzling
over that. There’s some kind of a mystery here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s Riddle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody knows. He didn’t stay at our hotel last night,
and Haley was not able to find him in town. He suddenly
and mysteriously disappeared. There is something queer
about this business, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I scent a mystery!” cried Frank. “Mysteries always
interest me. Wish I had time to solve this one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, don’t let it bother you. Here comes the train.
Remember your instructions. Of course, you know just
how the company stands, but Haley is holding fast to
Hawkins, and the old man will be able to work the ‘angel’
if we get into another hard place. We must strike better
business soon, and I guess we’ll pull out all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time later, Frank was seated on the train, waving
a farewell from the window to his two friends and the
stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hans and Ephraim stood side by side in solemn sorrow,
one tall, lank, angular, the other short, stout, rotund.
They presented a strong contrast, and Merry could not
help smiling a bit. Then came a thought that saddened
him somewhat. He could see there was a big change in
himself since the old, rollicking days at Fardale—he could
feel it. He had been forced to face the world and battle
for bread, and the circumstances and his advance in years
had wrought the change. He was no longer a thoughtless
boy; he felt the blood and vigor of dawning manhood in
his veins. Boyish things were past. Still he could enjoy
fun as well as ever, but the time when he was continually
planning and carrying into execution practical jokes was
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank believed that Hans and Ephraim saw the change
in him. Still he was sure their affection for him was as
strong and enduring as ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>They, too, had changed somewhat, for they had been
forced, like Frank, to win their way in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thinking it all over, Merry did not long to go back to his
boyhood days, pleasant though they had been. He realized
that he was enjoying life as he had never before
enjoyed it. The battles, the rebuffs, the triumphs, they
were something, worth living for, and they gave such a
pleasure to existence that it took away all regrets for his
lost boyhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he thought of Yale—dear old Yale! Then a
pang of regret shot through his heart, for he had not completed
his college course—he had not graduated with honors,
as he had believed he some day should.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the man who had robbed him of his fortune had
not prospered. For a long time the sword of justice had
been suspended over Darius Conrad’s head, and it had
seemed that it would never fall. The unscrupulous rascal
had gone on his wicked way unmolested till the tide turned
against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then his downward course had been swift and the end
awful. His ill-gotten gains melted away, and the man
who had been rich and the ruling power of the Blue Mountain
Railroad at last stood face to face with ruin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came another thought that added to his heartsore
feeling. Ephraim Gallup had brought him unpleasant
news of Elsie Bellwood. Her father was dead, and Elsie
was alone in the world, save for some not very closely
connected relatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Elsie! Thrown on her own resources, she must
find the struggle hard and trying. He did not even know
her address, so he could not write to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had fate parted them forever?</p>

<p class='c008'>That thought was maddening. He would not believe
anything so cruel had happened. Some time he would find
his little, blue-eyed sweetheart, and then they would be
parted never again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was musing thus when a man came out of the
smoker and dropped into the seat at his side, coolly observing:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine morning, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank looked up quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Riddle!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing,” nodded the advance man for the “Julian
King Stock Company.” “We seem to be traveling in the
same direction.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was not pleased. He did not like Riddle. There
was something about the fellow that struck him unfavorably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he said, shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Been having an after-breakfast smoke,” explained
Riddle. “Bad habit to smoke in the morning, but I’ve
fallen into it. Old Haley was looking for me last night,
wasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I knew better than to let him find me. He’s ugly
sometimes, and he hates King as much as King hates him.
He got King into a wild-cat scheme once and did him out
of a pretty little boodle. When they saw the show was
going to pieces, Haley planned to sell off a lot of the stuff
and get enough money to jump back to New York and
leave the company. King got ahead of him, though, and
did the trick first. Since then they have been ready to
shoot each other on sight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a different version of the story from the
one told Merry by Haley, and was an illustration of the
old axiom “there’s always two sides to a story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle rattled away with his talk. He told some stories,
one or two of which were not at all to Merriwell’s relish.
He cracked a few jokes, and he tried to show himself as
an all-round good fellow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The real fact is,” he finally said, “that old Haley is a
skin. He does everybody he can, and he’ll do you. Bet
he’ll stick you a right good bit by the time he gets ready
to drop you—that is, if he is able to hold his old show together,
which I doubt most mightily. Think he’ll be able
to keep it running another month?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think I would tell you if I didn’t believe he’d
be able to do that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you’re too stiff, my boy. You’ll get over that by
the time you’ve associated with theatrical managers as
long as yours truly. Now, look here, I’ve got a proposal
to make to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s this,” Riddle went on; “you give me the route of
your company, and I’ll give you mine. If you think this
isn’t a fair exchange, I might make it an object to you.
Old Haley needn’t know anything about it, and you can
nail a tenner down into your inside pocket. What do you
say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I say, Mr. Riddle,” said Frank, rising, his eyes flashing,
“that you are a confounded scoundrel! I don’t know
what your object is in wishing to learn the route of our
company, but I do know it cannot be an honest one, and
I do not wish to have anything further to do with you.
There are lots of vacant seats in this car, so be good
enough to get out of this one, or I shall throw you out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was straight talk, and Delvin Riddle did not misunderstand
it. He looked Frank over rather sneeringly,
then laughed in a most cutting manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, my young gamecock,” he chirped, “I’ll leave
you, for you are altogether too touchy. You are a very
fresh duck, and I’ll show you before many days that you’re
not half as smart as you fancy you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he got up, still laughing sneeringly, and retired
to the smoker.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t like to be taken for a scoundrel by such a fellow,”
he thought. “It galls me. But it certainly is a
singular thing that Riddle is so anxious to learn our route,
and it is far more singular that he has not learned it
through Collins. As Havener said, there is a mystery
about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was provided with a ticket to Dundee, but he
decided to get off at Salacia, the town from which Collins
had wired Haley that he had abandoned his job and joined
King’s company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something made Merry desirous of asking a few questions
about Weston Collins.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was near eleven o’clock in the forenoon when the
train arrived at Salacia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank got off.</p>

<p class='c008'>So did Delvin Riddle!</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>FRANK PUTS UP PAPER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>A surprise awaited Frank in Salacia. Of course, the
first thing he looked for on striking the town was the
billboards, expecting to find the “Empire Theater Comedy
Company’s” paper up everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a piece of that paper was in sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>But every billboard in town was covered with Julian
King’s paper, and the show windows were filled with his
lithographs!</p>

<p class='c008'>Without waiting for anything Frank sought the manager
of the opera house, for Salacia had but one first-class
theater.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manager was not at home, but his assistant, the
janitor of the building, was easily found, and he acknowledged
that he had charge of everything during Manager
Fuller’s absence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then,” said Merriwell, “you may be able to explain
to me why Julian King’s paper is on your billboards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name is Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what in——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am in advance of the ‘Empire Theater Comedy Company.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The deuce you are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s a letter from Mr. Barnaby Haley that may convince
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The janitor glanced over the sheet Frank spread before
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but a man by the name of Collins is their advance
agent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was, you mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He isn’t now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t understand——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither do I. We have the opera house engaged for
the eighteenth, and King is to play here the nineteenth,
yet his paper covers every board in town, and I can’t even
find one of our lithographs in a window. What does it
mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, your company has gone up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gone up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, bu’sted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dispatch from King said so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a malicious falsehood, and Mr. King should be
made to smart for it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was aroused, as his flashing eyes indicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but,” stammered the janitor, “Collins, your man,
he said it was no use to put up the rest of the paper. He
said so himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then he was here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And put up some of our paper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, about half of it. He went round with me. I do
the bill-posting sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did he happen to quit so suddenly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know. He received a telegram, and it seemed
to knock him all out. He just said it was no use to put
up any more paper, and stopped. I tried to get something
out of him, but he wouldn’t say a word. Next thing we
knew he was gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gone where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know. Just disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What next?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We had a telegram from King.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Saying the ‘Empire Theater Company’ had gone up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where is this paper you put up for us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Under King’s. That was put up over it right away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, that was a fine trick! Why didn’t you dispatch
to Mr. Haley and find out if King’s report was true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should we, after Collins acted so queer? Of
course, we thought it was true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was untrue, and it was a rascally piece of business,
for which King should be made to pay dearly.
Where is our paper that you hadn’t put up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it’s here somewhere, if it hasn’t been sent
away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sent away where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“With the rubbish. Man was here taking rubbish away
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now I want you to find out in a hurry if he has
taken that paper away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, what are you going to——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t stop to ask questions. Find that paper!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank’s tone made the janitor jump.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, sir!” he exclaimed. “Wait here a minute
and I’ll find out about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man was gone about two minutes, and then came
back, looking alarmed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s gone!” he declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then follow it!” shot from Frank Merriwell’s lips.
“Find it—recover it—bring it back! You must do it in
a hurry. That paper is going up right after dinner, and
I’ll be on hand to see that it goes up right. We’ll block
Mr. King’s little game right away. Now don’t make any
mistake, you must recover that paper, and you must be
ready to start with me at one o’clock to put it up. Have
everything ready then. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. I’ll be here on the dot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Frank hustled away.</p>

<p class='c008'>He inquired the way to the office of the local newspaper,
and went there direct, finding the editor just preparing to
go home to dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry introduced himself and chatted with the editor a
short time. He found the manager of the opera house
had brought in some notices of the Julian King Company,
but had furnished none of Haley &amp; Hawkins’ Company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank told just what sort of a trick King had attempted
to play, and the editor became somewhat interested.</p>

<p class='c008'>While they were talking there was a commotion on
the street, and, looking out, Frank saw a runaway horse
tearing along, with a little child, scarcely more than a baby,
clinging to the seat of the rocking carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like a flash, the ex-Yale athlete shot out of the door,
took a run in the same direction the frightened horse was
going, caught the animal by the bit, and stopped the creature
in less than six rods, by a wonderful display of
strength and skill.</p>

<p class='c008'>The owner of the turnout, who was also the father
of the child, came rushing up, pale and trembling, and
caught the uninjured little one in his arms, kissing and
caressing her.</p>

<p class='c008'>A crowd gathered and showered compliments on Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Young man,” cried the father, “you saved my Bessie’s
life! How can I pay the debt?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you,” smiled Frank; “take your family and
come see the ‘Empire Theater Comedy Company,’ which
plays here the evening of the eighteenth. You’ll see a
good show and get your money’s worth. Bring along
your friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do it!” exclaimed the man. “I’ll bring everybody
I can. Are you in the show?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m connected with it. Take this horse, somebody.
I’ve got some business with Mr. Jesper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jesper was the editor of the paper, and he walked back
to the office with Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a rattler,” he said, admiringly. “You made a
good hit in stopping Sam Henson’s horse. He thinks the
world of his child, and he’s got money to feed to the dogs.
If he took a fancy, he could buy up every seat in the opera
house and not feel it. It would be just like him to do it,
too. I’ll have to make a good item of your stopping his
horse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” laughed Frank, “as long as you wind
the item up by mentioning the ‘Empire Theater Comedy
Company.’ You mustn’t fail to do that. And here is some
other stuff I’d like to get into your column of locals.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He brought out the three news items he had written
but had forgotten to submit for Haley’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jesper looked them over and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, this is good stuff!” he declared. “It’s different
from the stuff usually brought in here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you use it all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, that is crowding us, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many seats do you wish?” asked Merry, bringing
out his passes. “Will six be enough?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The editor thought six might do, and he got them.
Then Frank made him promise to have the items set up
the first thing after dinner and a number of proofs taken
of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see, I have no copies to furnish other papers,”
Merry explained; “and a dozen proofs of each one of these
will be a great help to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shall have them,” assured Jesper.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Frank left that office, he was satisfied he had
done as well as any person could.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he went to the hotel where theatrical people usually
stopped, and, before dinner, he made arrangements
for the accommodation of the “Empire Theater Comedy
Company” when it arrived in town, getting a liberal reduction
on the regular rates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle was in the dining room when Frank entered, and
Merry took pains to get a seat at a table as far as possible
from the fellow. He observed that Riddle surveyed him
curiously, and he knew the fellow was wondering just
what he had been doing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry had hustled since striking town, accomplishing
a great deal in a remarkably short space of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank ate heartily, for he had a good appetite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle finished first, and he was waiting for Frank
in the office, smoking a good cigar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem full of business, Merriwell,” he observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Frank, shortly, and tried to move on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Attending to my business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be crusty, old fellow. We’re in the same line,
and there’s no reason why we should snarl at each other.
I don’t see where you are going to get board room for
your paper in this town. Our stuff is up on everything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll find room enough,” declared Frank, grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ll have to put up new boards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see how you’ll get round it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may find out later on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle was puzzled, as he plainly showed. He could not
get anything out of this remarkable young man who had
been sent out in advance of Haley &amp; Hawkins’ show, and,
as a rule, he was most successful in pumping anybody.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you going now?” he asked, desperately.</p>

<p class='c008'>“About my business, sir; hadn’t you better go about
yours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle flushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, keep it up!” he said, beginning to show anger.
“You give me pains! You’re altogether too new!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you are altogether too nosey, Mr. Riddle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank walked out of the office and made straight for
the opera house. Just as he reached the stage door, the
janitor came up with a wheelbarrow, on which was piled
the missing paper of the “Empire Theater Comedy Company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I found it!” he exclaimed, with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see you have,” nodded Frank, beginning to feel relieved
himself. “Now, we must make a hustle to get it
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But where shall we put it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On every billboard in town belonging to this opera
house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The janitor gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but Julian King’s paper is up on those boards!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all the paper he sent us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We—we can’t cover his paper!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t we? Well, get your paste and brush, and we’ll
see if we can. Be lively, now, for I must catch a train to-night,
and I’ve got some hustling to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The janitor seemed dazed. He got his paste bucket and
brush, and then he and Frank started out. They began
with the board on the side of the opera house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gracious!” gasped the janitor, as they prepared to put
the paper on. “What will King do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has done what he had no right to do now, and he
can’t do anything about this. Our paper is going up on
these boards to stay till the night we play here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll give King only one day of advertising on the
billboards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s not my concern. If he makes a date to play
in a town one day behind another show, he must take his
chances on the advertising he can secure. You can see
that he is a scoundrel, or he would not have resorted to
the trick to obtain these boards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how do you explain the action of Collins?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t explain it. Haven’t time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were fairly at work when the janitor looked up
the street and saw Delvin Riddle rushing in that direction,
exhibiting unmistakable signs of wrath.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was plain Riddle had been in Salacia before, and
was known to the janitor, for that individual dropped his
brush, gasping:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good Lord! Now there’ll be a muss!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank caught up the brush and continued the work
of putting up the sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle came up panting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here!” he shouted, as he approached; “what in thunder
are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank made a skillful swipe up the middle of the sheet
with his brush, securing the paper at one stroke, then
swiftly stroked it to the right and left, affixing it in its
proper place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem to be excited, Mr. Riddle,” he coolly observed,
as King’s advance man came tearing up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to know what in blazes you are doing!” roared
Riddle, wrathfully, his face fairly purple.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Putting up paper!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’re putting it over our paper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you dare do such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s easy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I forbid it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank smiled placidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out, Mr. Riddle,” he said, with mock concern,
“or you will choke yourself with excitement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I forbid you to put on another piece of paper!” roared
Riddle, shaking his fist at Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forbid and be—blessed! It goes up just the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll get yourself into trouble!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Julian King will get himself into trouble, if he telegraphs
any more lies about the ‘Empire Theater Company.’
He got this paper of his up here through misrepresentation
and fraud. Now let him put some more up
when we are through with the boards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank prepared to go on with his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pass me up the next sheet, Mr. Hobbs,” he said,
speaking to the janitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you do it!” ordered Riddle. “You are getting
yourself into trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The janitor seemed doubtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve already gotten yourself into trouble, Mr.
Hobbs,” declared Merry, “if Barnaby Haley sees fit to
make trouble about it. You know you had no right to
cover such of our paper as was up, and you also know
that we own these boards till ten o’clock on the night of
the eighteenth. Pass up that sheet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had won.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s right, Mr. Riddle,” said the janitor. “The boards
belong to Haley, and we’ll have to put his paper up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle saw his game of bluff was called, and, furious
at his defeat, he lifted his foot and kicked over the bucket
of paste.</p>

<p class='c008'>Quick as a flash, Merry turned and gave the brush a
slash across the fellow’s face, filling his mouth, nose and
eyes with the sticky stuff.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle swore, spitting, blowing, rubbing at his eyes with
a handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put down that brush, and I’ll fight you!” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go away,” advised Frank. “I don’t want to fight with
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t dare to fight! You’re a coward!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Merriwell did not fancy being called that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go away, Riddle,” he again advised. “You will be
sorry if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow fancied Merry was afraid of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you deserve is a good thrashing, to take some
of the freshness out of you!” he shouted, having mopped
the most of the paste off his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be so stuck up,” said Frank, with a bit of a
smile. “What you need is some good soap and water to
use on your face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You confounded fresh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle started toward Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait!”</p>

<p class='c008'>That one word fell sharply from Merry’s lips. He
leaned the long-handled brush against the billboard and
turned to meet his angry enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, now,” he said, gently. “Come ahead, and
I’ll make it interesting for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle hesitated a single instant, and then he saw something
like a grin on the face of the watching janitor.
That decided him. He made a spring for Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out shot Merriwell’s arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c008'>The blow sounded almost like a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Delvin Riddle was knocked down on the instant, and
struck sprawling in the overturned mass of paste. In that
he sprawled around for a moment, and, when he got up,
he was a sight to behold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle looked at himself, then looked at Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shall pay for this!” he grated. “I’ll see you
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of spectators had gathered, and they were
laughing openly over Riddle’s ludicrous appearance as he
hurried away. The fellow was thoroughly crestfallen,
but in his heart he swore vengeance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There seems to be enough paste in the bottom of the
bucket for this board, Mr. Hobbs,” said Merriwell, calmly.
“Now we will go on with our work.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>“STOP THIEF!”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Of course, there was not enough paper left to completely
cover all the boards, but Frank was determined
to hide King’s stuff, so he went to the printing office and
secured a supply of white paper. Then he would put up
two or three three-sheet posters on a large board, covering
everything else with the white paper. In this manner
he hid all of King’s advertising on the billboards.</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw nothing more of Delvin Riddle while he was at
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the janitor to finish the last of this work, he
took some window posters and started out.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found King’s stuff in all the best windows, but in
many of them got his in beside the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>The story of his encounter with Riddle had spread
through the place, and everybody seemed anxious to know
the particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank took pains to tell just what kind of a trick
Julian King had tried to play on them in that place, and
he had a way of telling it so that it made a very good
story and gave a favorable impression of the “Empire
Theater Comedy Company.” Frank was satisfied that the
things which had happened in Salacia would be strictly
to the advantage of the show with which he was connected.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was judicious but not niggardly in giving out passes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before night Jesper, the editor of the local paper, hunted
him up and asked for particulars concerning his encounter
with Riddle. Frank made the account very ludicrous, and
Jesper promised to put it in the paper in such a manner
that it would make Merriwell appear to advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Frank had a hustle to catch a train—and missed
it!</p>

<p class='c008'>This filled him with dismay, for he had spent a day in
Salacia when he should have been in Dundee.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found there were no other trains over that road
that would take him to Dundee that night, but there was
a train over another road some ten miles away that might
be flagged at a little village, and that would carry him to
the place he wished to reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately Frank made a rush for the nearest livery
stable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to hire a good horse,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What for?” asked the hostler, shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To take me to Kilmerville in time to catch the night
train west.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Train doesn’t stop there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it can be flagged, can’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’ll try to flag it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t believe you can get there in time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t you got a horse that can take me there? I
must get there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t know about letting you have Jack.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which is Jack?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Black horse in that stall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He looks all right. Can he get me to Kilmerville in
time for me to flag the train?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I want him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name is Merriwell. I’m in advance of the ‘Empire
Theater Comedy Company.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! Then you’re the fellow that stopped Sam Henson’s
horse?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve heard all about that. You look all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you pasted up the other show chap?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we had a little trouble, and I believe he did
get covered with paste.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I like your appearance,” said the hostler. “I reckon
you’re all right. Where’ll you leave Jack?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At the station at Kilmerville.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get somebody to take him to Pete Newell’s stable.
I’ll send over for him in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I may have him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For five dollars—yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s your cash.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had the money out in a moment and into the
hand of the hostler.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get the saddle on that horse in a hurry!” he exclaimed.
“I’ll have to get my satchel from the hotel, but I’ll be
back here right away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Horse’ll be ready when you get back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry made a run for the hotel. Up to his room he
dashed, catching up his satchel and securing it over his
shoulder by the strap. Down to the office he plunged.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one there.</p>

<p class='c008'>He pounded on the desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down to the cardroom he rushed. Outside the door he
stopped suddenly, hearing a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“His name is Frank Merriwell. Here’s your warrant,
sheriff. Arrest him on sight. I’m sure you’ll find my
watch on his person. If not, then he’s got rid of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Delvin Riddle was speaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>For one moment Frank was aghast, dazed, bewildered.</p>

<p class='c008'>What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c008'>Through his brain flashed the explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riddle, driven desperate by his failure to frighten
Frank, furious over the treatment he had received at Merriwell’s
hands, had put up a job to detain Merriwell in
Salacia. He had sworn out a warrant, charging Frank
with stealing his watch, and Merriwell was to be arrested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nice trick!” thought Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>He felt like walking into that cardroom and finishing
the half-completed job of thrashing the tricky advance
man of the “Julian King Stock Company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But he knew that would not do, for he would be arrested
and detained in Salacia just when it was most
important that he should reach Dundee and attend to his
business.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stepped a bit nearer the open door. Inside the room
was a mirror, and in that mirror he saw the reflection
of two men. One was Riddle, smooth-faced, crafty, malicious;
the other was the sheriff, large, rough, booted.
The latter was looking at the warrant just given him by
Frank’s enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he said. “You’d better come along with
me and point the fellow out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s time to be moving!” thought Merry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up the stairs he skipped.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clerk had just come in, and was at the desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My bill!” said Frank, sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your bill?” said the clerk, languidly. “Aren’t you
going to stop overnight?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Business. Got to go. My bill, quick! I’m in a
hurry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The clerk looked at the register and then told him what
his bill would be. Frank flung down some money. He
heard heavy feet ascending the stairs to the office. He
heard voices. Riddle and the sheriff were coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep the change,” said Merriwell. “Can’t stop for
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He bolted out of the door, leaving the amazed clerk
staring after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Straight for the livery stable he darted. The hostler
was in the wide open door, holding the black horse, ready
saddled and bridled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind Frank there was a hoarse command. He looked
over his shoulder and saw the sheriff and Riddle come
rushing out of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop!” yelled Riddle. “Stop thief!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank reached the stable door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that they’re yelling at you?” asked the hostler,
with an air of sudden distrust.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll tell you when they get here,” half laughed
Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t think I’ll let you have this horse just now.
You’ll have to wait a while before you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t stop, sir. I’m in a great hurry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I won’t——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, you will!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank caught him by the collar, at the same time grasping
the horse by the bit. With all his strength, the ex-Yale
man gave the burly hostler a snap and a fling.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hostler was literally lifted off his feet and sent
spinning through an open door into the little room that
served as an office.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horse reared and snorted. He came down and
reared again. When he went into the air Frank went
with him, swinging onto his back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Git!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of the stable door shot the black horse, bearing
Frank on its back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-by!” he called. “I’ll see you later, Mr. Riddle!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop him!” howled Riddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheriff tried to catch the horse by the bit, missed,
grasped at Frank’s leg, touched it—that was all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Onward shot the horse and rider. Frank turned and
waved his hand with a taunting movement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thief! thief!—stop thief!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is a pleasant cry to hear!” commented Merry,
grimly. “I’ll remember Mr. Delvin Riddle for this little
piece of business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked back and saw men and boys running after
him, shouting for him to stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cloud of dust rose behind the heels of the horse, for
it was dry in the streets of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cries grew fainter and fainter. Frank turned onto
another street, and his pursuers were seen no more for
a time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>THE FINISH OF THE RACE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Frank had not asked directions, and he knew not which
way Kilmerville lay, so he was forced to stop and make
inquiries.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found he had started in the wrong direction, and,
in order to get onto the right road, he must go back
through the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll be first rate!” he thought, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he turned back, taking another street. He was
obliged to ride directly through the heart of the town,
and he saw some men in the livery stable making hasty
preparations for pursuit. Horses were being saddled for
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it’s going to be a race to Kilmerville,” he muttered.
“All right. That’ll add to the excitement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There he is!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cry went up from a number of men and boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop thief!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop me!” invited Merriwell. “Try it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of the stable door dashed two mounted men, followed
by a third. The hostler, believing he had let an
animal to a rascal, had joined Riddle and the sheriff in
the chase.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By Jove!” exclaimed Frank. “This thing is getting
mighty serious. I don’t fancy being chased about over
the country and called a thief. If it wasn’t for business,
I’d go back and face the thing; but that would be playing
right into Riddle’s hands. No, I’ll catch that train if I
can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the town he rattled. The black horse was
spirited and speedy. He believed he had been given the
best mount in the stable. If that was true, his pursuers
would have some trouble overtaking him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Surely he was finding excitement enough ahead of
the show to satisfy the most morbid craving for something
stirring.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were several streets leading out of the town
on that side, and he was forced to choose one by chance,
trusting to fortune to put him onto the right one.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was fortunate, indeed, for he chose the road to
Kilmerville.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was clear of the town, he looked back and saw
his pursuers coming. He waved his hand tauntingly at
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have the satisfaction of giving them a merry race,
anyhow,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>The country was undulating, and he soon passed over
a rise. Then he looked back and did not see his pursuers
for a time, but they finally came up over the rise.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roads outside the town were not in the best condition,
but this disadvantage to Frank was also a disadvantage
to those who were following him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He kept looking for sign boards, as, at that time, he was
not sure he had struck the right road.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he dashed past a branch road, an old, weather-beaten
board told him he was all right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurrah!” he cried, enthusiastically. “That’s the stuff!
Now let them come on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came another thought. What if he reached Kilmerville
too soon, giving his pursuers time to come up and
capture him before the train arrived?</p>

<p class='c008'>That would be quite as bad as missing the train.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he remembered his conversation with the hostler,
and he was satisfied that he did not have any time to spare.
He must put as much distance as possible between himself
and his pursuers before Kilmerville was reached, and
then trust to fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank talked to his mount, and it was not long before
he decided that the animal was unusually intelligent. He
sought to make friends with the horse, believing that the
best way to get the best work out of the animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Occasionally he looked back. For some time he could
obtain occasional glimpses of his three pursuers, but he
was drawing away from them, and, at last, they were not
to be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s getting quieter,” he murmured; “but the excitement
may not be over. I suppose Riddle will follow me
to Dundee and have me arrested there; but it will give
me time to get in some more work, I hope, and send a
telegram to Haley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He kept on at a good pace till he came to another branch
road. He looked the roads over, and then selected the
one to the right, for there was no guide board to tell him
which way to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had ridden on nearly half a mile when he met a
man in a wagon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank drew up, lifting his hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you tell me, sir,” he asked, “if this is the right
road to Kilmerville?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sur, I kin,” nodded the man in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he was silent, staring searchingly at Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, will you tell me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huah! Yep!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this the right road?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huah! Nope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope. Right road is ’bout half a mile back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank wheeled about in double quick haste. Back
along the road he sent the black horse flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jeeminy!” muttered the old fellow in the wagon.
“He must be in an awful hurry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank feared his pursuers would reach the junction of
the two roads ahead of him and cut him off, so he pushed
the black horse to its highest speed. The creature responded
nobly, fairly flying over the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t mind owning you,” thought Merry. “Too
bad you’re kept in a livery stable and let out to every
Tom, Dick and Harry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he approached the junction of the roads, he began
looking for the pursuers. It was not long before he
saw them come over a rise, and an exclamation of dismay
broke from his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll get there ahead of me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw they must, and his mind was quickly made up
on the course he would pursue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know what kind of a hurdle horse you are, old
fellow,” he said; “but I’m going to try some cross-country
riding with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He swung out of the road, aimed at the fence, and
the black rose to the touch, clearing the rails like a flying
bird.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then a cheer broke from Merry’s lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was answered by shouts from the three men, who
now saw him. They whipped their horses along the
road as fast as possible, trying to cut him off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, the ground was not firm beneath the feet of
the black horse, and it did seem for a time that Merriwell
might be intercepted. But he reached the road in
advance of the trio of pursuers, the black again clearing
the fence beautifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop!” roared the sheriff. “Stop, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t,” Frank called back. “I’m in a great hurry.
Sorry I can’t jog along with you. Ta, ta!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waved his hand tauntingly, turning in the saddle to
do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that instant the black horse stepped on a loose
stone, and a second later Merriwell was off and the animal
was down. A shout of triumph came from the pursuers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like a flash Frank sprang up, and the horse rose at the
same instant. Into the saddle Merry leaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go it, my boy—fine boy!” the fugitive called, and
away sprang the horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pursuing men expressed their rage and dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the noble horse had been injured, and it was not
many moments before Frank saw the creature was going
lame. This caused Merry some anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good boy—noble fellow!” he said, leaning forward and
patting the creature’s glossy neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horse turned its head a bit, its breath fluttering
through its throbbing nostrils. It seemed that a bond of
sympathy had been established between horse and rider,
and the intelligent animal was straining every nerve to do
its best.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pursuers saw something was wrong, saw the horse
was lame, and again they shouted their triumph.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hostler excepted. He was enraged, and he gave
vent to his anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fellow has spoiled our best saddle horse,” he
grated. “He shall pay for it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll overtake him now,” declared the sheriff. “He
can’t get away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Delvin Riddle laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has given us lots of trouble,” said the advance
agent. “But now he’s in double trouble. If I don’t get
back my watch, he’ll be detained to settle for that horse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’ll be detained to push your charge against
him,” said the sheriff.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” cried Riddle. “Why, my business won’t
permit that. I have to attend to my business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You swore out the warrant and gave it to me to serve.
Now you will have to let your business hang while you
appear in court and press the charge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That did not suit Riddle at all. His object had been
to bother and detain Merriwell, while he went on, and he
really had no intention of appearing at the trial.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you’ll detain me, and then again perhaps you
won’t,” he thought; but he kept this thought to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was seen that Merriwell’s mount was failing rapidly,
and Frank plainly showed some anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheriff looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll not reach Kilmerville in time to stop that train,”
he declared. “We’ve got him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Merriwell was sparing the black horse as much
as possible, hoping the creature would hold out. He
saw he could not run away from his pursuers, and his
only object was to keep in advance of them sufficiently
to catch the train and get away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was anxious, but still he kept cool. He knew
Riddle could not prove the malicious charge of robbery,
and he also knew the fellow could make trouble for him
in Dundee if he saw fit to follow the game up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry had made up his mind to telegraph to Haley
from Dundee as soon as the place was reached, in case
he escaped the pursuers. In that way he could put the
manager onto the main points of the crooked business
the rival concern had attempted to carry out.</p>

<p class='c008'>At times it seemed that the black horse must give
out entirely, but Frank encouraged the creature without
attempting to force it along, and the animal responded
bravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad, old boy!” muttered the youth, sympathetically.
“Hope I’ll not lame you permanently by driving
you this way. If I knew I should, I’d be tempted to
stop right here and let those chaps take me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking back, he saw the pursuers lashing their horses
and making renewed efforts to overtake him in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking to the left and southeast, he detected a faint
trail of smoke against the evening sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came the far-away, wailing shriek of a locomotive
whistle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By Jove!” Merry muttered. “That’s my train! Kilmerville
must be just beyond the next rise. Looks to
me as if I’ll have a hard pull to make connections with
that train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now he did all he could to urge the black horse onward.
There seemed a magic persuasion about his voice,
for the animal actually appeared to fling off much of its
lameness and shoot ahead with fresh fire and speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up the rise they went. The crest was reached and,
ahead in the valley, Merry saw Kilmerville.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anxiously he turned his eyes in the direction of the
trailing smoke that rose against the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too near!” came through his teeth. “I’ll lose at
the last minute! It is a howling shame!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the twentieth time his hand patted the sweat-stained
neck and his voice poured encouragement into
those backward-tilted ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve done a fine job, my gallant boy. Faster—a
little faster, noble fellow! I’ll not forget this ride—I’ll
not forget you! If I had the money I’d buy you and
take care of you the rest of your life for this. Get me
there in time to catch that train, my boy! On, on!
That’s the stuff! Now you are doing it! Good boy—fine
boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was wonderful how that injured animal tore down
the road toward the little collection of houses huddled
at the railroad crossing. Frank felt himself thrill with
the excitement of it all.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horse’s sides were heaving and falling, while its
breath came puffing from its nostrils like steam from
an exhaust pipe.</p>

<p class='c008'>That line of smoke was coming nearer and nearer.
The whistle of the locomotive sounded like a taunting
yell of derision.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lost the race!” grated Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still he kept on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The train was close to the little village, but the black
horse bore its rider toward the crossing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry saw the train for a moment, then lost it behind
some houses. He tore off his hat and waved it as he
went madly galloping toward that crossing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind him the pursuers again shouted their triumph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You haven’t got me yet!” muttered the desperate
youth. “I’d do ’most anything to give you the slip
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was near the crossing when the engine went past.
The engineer did not see him, and he knew his last
chance to stop the train had passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not check the horse, and one or two open-mouthed,
staring villagers believed he would dash
straight against the cars, be hurled to the ground, possibly
mangled beneath the iron wheels.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all his strength Frank turned the horse to one
side, so that it was going in the same direction as the
train.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he formed a resolve, marvelous, daring, foolhardy.
The pursuers gasped, for they saw him rise to
his knees on the back of the horse. Then, with the skill
of a circus rider, he stood upright on the back of the
galloping animal!</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment the desperate youth stood thus, and then,
as the last car of the train whirled by, Frank made a
daring leap.</p>

<p class='c008'>His act was greeted with shouts of astonishment, for
it seemed that no person in his right mind would venture
to attempt such an astounding thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the air Frank Merriwell shot, his hands
clutched the rail of the rear platform of the last car—clutched
it and clung there. For a second his body
was straightened out in the air till it was in a position
almost horizontal. Then it swung in, and the youth
stood erect on the platform, laughing, triumphant, tauntingly
and leisurely lifting his hat and waving it in farewell
toward his baffled and thunderstruck pursuers.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>ALL QUIET.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c002'>Frank expected to meet an officer at the station when
he reached Dundee late that night, for he fancied Riddle,
intending to keep up the game, would telegraph ahead
for his arrest.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he stepped down from the train, Merry looked
around for the expected sheriff or policeman.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one was there to meet him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was pretty tired, and so he took a carriage to a
hotel, where he registered, and asked if he could get
something to eat. It was long past the supper hour, but
he was able to obtain a lunch, which satisfied him very
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next Frank sent a telegram to Barnaby Haley, and
then sat down and wrote a letter, telling briefly his adventures
since starting out as advance man for the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time it was pretty late, and he decided to retire
and get some sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was filled with wonder because he had not been
molested in Dundee, but decided that Riddle had resolved
to come on himself and see to the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fully convinced that there would be more trouble for
him in the morning, he went to his room.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he was preparing to go to bed, he thought of Cassie
and his last talk with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor girl!” thought Frank. “I wonder if she really
prayed to-night and tried to go through her part without
the stimulation of morphine. It is too bad that the
accursed drug should get such a hold on such a girl.
She said she would pray for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was about to jump into bed when another thought
came to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said I would pray for her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Down beside the bed Frank Merriwell knelt. He
bowed his head, and his lips moved in a whispered
prayer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who can say that prayer was not heard—and answered?</p>

<p class='c008'>For all of the exciting adventures of the day, Frank
was soon sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was aroused by a sharp knocking on his door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello!” he muttered, as he sat up. “Here’s the
trouble I’ve been expecting! They might have let me
sleep till morning. Wonder if they will take me to some
wretched lockup and give me a buggy bunk. If they
do, I’ll have to stay up the rest of the night. I enjoy
excitement, but I draw the line at night encounters with
bugs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up leisurely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rat-tat-tat!</p>

<p class='c008'>The person outside the door was getting impatient.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” called Merry, placidly.
“I won’t jump out of the window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me in!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Directly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank struck a match and lighted the gas. Then, in
his nightgown, he opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man dodged in quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut the door!” he ordered, his voice and manner betraying
agitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” asked Frank, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lock it—lock it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger took hold of the key and turned it himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank’s surprise increased.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he said, looking the man over, “will you be
good enough to tell me what this means?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. Take a good look at me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your name’s Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“New man ahead of the ‘Empire Theater Comedy
Company’?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m Collins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank jumped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Collins?” he cried—“Weston Collins?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had never seen the former advance man of the
company, so it was not strange he had not known Collins.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he said, sitting down on the edge of the bed
and staring hard at the intruder, “what in the name of
all that’s bad are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came in a little while ago. Saw your name on the
register. You registered with the name of the company
attached, so I knew you must be the man Haley had sent
out to fill my place. I came up to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did King send you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“King! What made you think so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On account of your telegram.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Telegram to whom?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Haley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What telegram?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one you sent from Salacia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never sent any.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was surprised and incredulous. Was this more
trickery?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never sent Haley a telegram,” declared Collins. “Did
he receive one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name signed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fake! King did it—or somebody representing King.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry was doubtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did it say?” asked Collins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank told him, and the former advance man showed
anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just like King!” he cried. “He hates Haley, and he
will do anything to torment the old man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but you dropped the work in Salacia. Manager
of the opera house heard our company had gone up. He
put King’s paper right up over what you had put up for
us. Why did you do that way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Collins hesitated a little, and then, walking up and
down, he began:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Merriwell, I want to set myself straight,
but I don’t know how to do it. That’s why I’m here.
I’m taking all chances of being arrested.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Arrested?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. It’s like this: I got into some trouble out here
in this country once, and had to skip. I’ve kept it quiet
all my life—never told anybody about it. King knew it,
because he was with me at the time. I changed my name.
Collins is not my right name. When Haley decided to
book this section, I tried to persuade him not to do it.
Didn’t want to come here. Had to come or throw up
my job. Thought I might get into the county and out
again without being recognized. Could have done it, but
when King heard we were having a hard time to hold the
show together, he believed he could knock the company
out by driving me off. He gave me an hour to get out
of Salacia before he put the officers on me. I was scared
and made a run for it. He must have had his advance
man send the telegram from Salacia. I suppose he has
told everything, and they are looking for me; but I made
up my mind I’d go back and see Haley. That’s why I’m
here. I’ve got back this far. Registered here to-night
under a fake name. Have telegraphed Haley myself.
Did that as soon as I got over my scare. That’s the whole
thing in a nutshell. I won’t be able to stay with the
company, and I’m glad they had a man to send right out
in my place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had been watching the man as he told the story,
and Merry was convinced that Collins was not lying.
He could see that the fellow was just recovering from
the effects of too much liquor, which helped serve to
explain his singular conduct in taking flight without
notifying Haley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Merry talked with Collins for at least two hours, telling
him everything that had happened since he started out
in advance of the show.</p>

<p class='c008'>Collins complimented him on his ability and the manner
in which he had gotten the best of Delvin Riddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is my opinion,” he said, “that Riddle is thoroughly
disgusted over the attempt to side track you, and I don’t
fancy you’ll have any more trouble with him. He has
found out that you are up to snuff and too smart for him.
It is quite probable that, when he got back in Salacia, he
made a find that caused him to withdraw that warrant
from the hands of the sheriff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of a find?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The stolen watch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank brightened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand!” he exclaimed. “Riddle may have done
that in order to avoid being detained himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just that. He’s liable to be on here to-morrow, and
you’ll soon find out if he’s going to let you alone. I
shall get out of town the first thing in the morning, and
I’ll lay low till I can rejoin the company somewhere outside
the State.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Everything turned out just as Collins had fancied it
would. Riddle appeared the following day, but he did
not even seem to see Merriwell. Frank was not molested
then or afterward by Julian King’s agent.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Frank found that work on the road as an
advance agent was a great deal easier than it had appeared
at the start. In defeating the schemes of his
rivals he had overcome the greatest difficulties of his
new career, and though he found other obstacles from
time to time, he met them with the same steady courage
that was sure to win in the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>He proved one of the finest advance agents that had
ever traveled for Haley, and made a host of friends
wherever he went.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
